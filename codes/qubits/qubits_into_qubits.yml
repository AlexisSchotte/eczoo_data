name: 'Qubit code'

description: 'Encodes \(K\)-dimensional Hilbert space into a \(2^n\)-dimensional (\(n\)-qubit) Hilbert space; has distance \(d\). Usually denoted as \(((n,K,d))\), or \([[n,k,d]]\) when \(K=2^k\). The distance is the minimum weight of an error that implements a nontrivial logical operation on the code.'

protection: 'Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits.'
