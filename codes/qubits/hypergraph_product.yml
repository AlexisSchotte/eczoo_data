code_id: hypergraph_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Hypergraph product'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2013.2292061}'

description: 'A family of \([[N,K,D]]\) CSS stabiliser codes whose construction is based on two binary linear \textit{seed} codes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\). In contrast to the original CSS construction there are no restrictions on the form of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\). Hypegraph product codes are a special case of the homological product obtained from the product of two length-two chain complexes.'

protection: 'The hypergraph product has distance \(D=O(\sqrt{N})\). The number of encoded logical qubits is \(K=O(k_1k_2)\) where \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) are the dimensions of the classical seed codes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'

notes:
  - 'The surface code can be constructed form the hypergraph product of two repetition codes. Similarily, the toric code is obtained from the hypergraph product of two closed-loop repetition codes.'

    - code_id: quantum_ldpc
      detail: 'The sparsity of the seed codes \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) is preserved by the hypergraph product (up to a constant factor). The hypergraph product of two classical LDPC codes therefore yields a quantum LDPC code.'
