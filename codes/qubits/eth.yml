name: 'Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) code'

introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.110502}'

description: 'ETH codes are approximate quantum error correcting codes whose codespace is formed by eigenstates of a quantum many-body system which satisfies the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. ETH requires that for ordered energy eigenstates \(|E_l\rangle\) and any local observable \(O\), \(|\langle E_l|O|E_l\rangle-\langle E_{l+1}|O|E_{l+1}\rangle|\leq\text{exp}(-cn)\), where \(c\) is a constant and \(n\) is the number of qubits. This implies that energy eigenstates around \(\bar E\) are approximately locally indistinguishable from one another, as their reduced density matrices are both on any subsystem are both approximately thermal at energy \(\bar E\). In this way, global information is protected from local measurements by the environment.'

protection: 'Approximately protects against erasure errors at known locations. The ETH code generated from the spectrum of the translation-invariant 1D Heisenberg spin chain \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.110502} has approximation parameter (against the erasure of a constant number of sites) which scales as \(\epsilon_\text{worst}(\mathcal{N}\circ\mathcal{E}=O(1/n)\), where \(\mathcal{E}\) is the encoder, \(\mathcal{N}\) is the noise map, and \(n\) is the number of physical qubits \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevX.10.041018}. \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.110502} also shows that translation-invariance alone is sufficient for hosting AQECC in a many-body spectrum, including in integrable models.'
