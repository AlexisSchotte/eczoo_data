code_id: qecc_finite
#physical: bits
#logical: qubits

name: 'Quantum error-correcting code (QECC) in finite dimensions'

# Following Gottesman's book
description: 'Encodes quantum information in a \(K\)-dimensional (\textit{logical}) subspace \(\mathsf{H_K}\) of an \(N\)-dimensional (\textit{physical}) Hilbert space \(\mathsf{H_N}\) such that it is possible to recover said information from errors. A finite-dimensional QECC \((U,\cal{E})\) is a partial isometry \(U:\mathsf{H}_{K}\to\mathsf{H}_{N}\) with the set of correctable errors \(\cal{E}:\mathsf{H}_N\to\mathsf{H}_M\) with the following property: there exists a quantum operation \(\cal{D}:\mathsf{H}_M\to \mathsf{H}_K\) such that for all \(E\in\cal{E}\) and states \(|\psi\rangle\in\mathsf{H}_{K}\), \({\cal D}(EU|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|U^{\dagger}E^{\dagger})=c(E,|\psi\rangle)|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) for some constant \(c\).'
