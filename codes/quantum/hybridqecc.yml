name: 'Hybrid QECC'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0608071,arxiv:0802.2414}'

description: |
  A quantum code which encodes both quantum and classical information.
  Usually denoted as \(((n,K:M))\) or \(((n,K:M,d))\), where \(K\) is the dimension of the underlying quantum code, where \(M\) is the size of the classical code, and where \(d\) is the distance.

  A simple example of a hybrid QECC encodes a single qubit and a single classical bit.
  A different quantum code \(\mathsf{C}_j\) is associated with each of the two values \(j\in\{0,1\}\) of the classical bit.
  The error words corresponding to correctable errors must satisfy the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions} for each code \cite[Eq. (3)]{arxiv:1701.06963}, and error words beloning to different codes must be orthogonal to each other \cite[Eq. (4)]{arxiv:1701.06963}.
  The corresponding decomposition of the hilbert space is
  \begin{align}
    \mathsf{C}_{1}\oplus\mathsf{C}_{2}\oplus\mathsf{C}^{\perp}~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\mathsf{C}^\perp\) is the combined error space of both codes.
