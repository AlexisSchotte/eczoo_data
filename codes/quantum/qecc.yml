description: |
  Encodes quantum information in a (\textit{logical}) subspace of a
  (\textit{physical}) Hilbert space such that it is possible to recover said
  information from errors that act as linear maps on the physical space. The
  logical subspace is spanned by a basis comprised of \textit{code basis states}
  or \textit{codewords}. Codewords may not be normalizable if the physical
  Hilbert space in infinite, so approximate versions have to be constructed in
  practice.

protection: |
  Denoting Hilbert spaces by the letter \(\mathsf{H}\), a quantum code
  \((U,\cal{E})\) is a partial isometry
  \(U:\mathsf{H}_{\text{logical}}\to\mathsf{H}_{\text{physical}}\) with a set of
  correctable errors \(\cal{E}\) with the following property: there exists a
  quantum operation \(\cal{D}\) such that for all \(E\in\cal{E}\) and states
  \(|\psi\rangle\in\mathsf{H}_{\text{logical}}\),
  \begin{align}
    {\cal D} (EU|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|U^{\dagger}E^{\dagger})
    = c(E,|\psi\rangle)|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|
  \end{align}
  for some constant \(c\).
  
  \subsection{Conditions for quantum error correction}
  Equivalently, correction capability is determined by of the \textit{quantum
  error-correction conditions}
  \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9604034,arXiv:quant-ph/9604024}, which may admit infinite
  terms due to non-normalizability of ideal code states. A code that satisfies
  these conditions approximately, i.e., up to some small quantifiable error, is
  called an \hyperref[code:approximate_qecc]{approximate code}.

  \begin{defterm}{Knill-Laflamme conditions}
    \paragraph{Knill-Laflamme error correction conditions}
    In a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there are necessary and sufficient
    conditions for a code to successfully
    correct a set of errors.  These are called the \emph{Knill-Laflamme
    conditions}~\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9604034,preset:PreskillNotes,doi:10.1017/CBO9780511976667}.
    Using the notation above, a code \(U\) with code space projector \(\Pi = U U^\dagger\)
    can correct a set of errors \(\{ E_j \}\) if and only if
    \begin{align}
      \Pi E_i E_j^\dagger \Pi = c_{ij}\, \Pi\qquad\text{for all \(i,j\),}
    \end{align}
    where \(c_{ij}\) can be arbitrary numbers.
