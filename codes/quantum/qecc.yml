# Following Gottesman's book, but removed finite dims
description: |
  Encodes quantum information in a (\textit{logical}) subspace of a
  (\textit{physical}) Hilbert space such that it is possible to recover said
  information from errors that act as linear maps on the physical space. The
  logical subspace is spanned by a basis comprised of \textit{code basis states}
  or \textit{codewords}. Codewords may not be normalizable if the physical
  Hilbert space in infinite, so approximate versions have to be constructed in
  practice.

protection: |
  Denoting Hilbert spaces by the letter \(\mathsf{H}\), a quantum code
  \((U,\cal{E})\) is a partial isometry
  \(U:\mathsf{H}_{\text{logical}}\to\mathsf{H}_{\text{physical}}\) with a set of
  correctable errors \(\cal{E}\) with the following property: there exists a
  quantum operation \(\cal{D}\) such that for all \(E\in\cal{E}\) and states
  \(|\psi\rangle\in\mathsf{H}_{\text{logical}}\),
  \begin{align}
    {\cal D} (EU|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|U^{\dagger}E^{\dagger})
    = c(E,|\psi\rangle)|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|
  \end{align}
  for some constant \(c\).

  Equivalently, correction capability is determined by the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions}, which may admit infinite terms due to non-normalizability of ideal code states in the case of codes with infinite-dimenional physical spaces. A code that satisfies these conditions approximately, i.e., up to some small quantifiable error, is called an \hyperref[code:approximate_qecc]{approximate code}. These conditions can also be formulated in terms of a dual Heisenberg picture, where correctability is checked for some algebra of observables \cite{arxiv:0811.0421}.
