  2BGA codes are the smallest \hyperref[code:lifted_product]{LP codes}
  LP\((a,b)\), constructed from a pair of group algebra elements
  \(a,b\in \mathbb{F}_q[G]\), where \(G\) is a finite group and \(\mathbb{F}_q\) is a Galois field.
  For a group of order \(\ell\), we get a 2BGA code of length
  \(n=2\ell\).

  For a given field \(\mathbb{F}_q\) and a finite group \(G\) of order
  \(|G|=\ell\), the \textit{group algebra} (a ring) \(\mathbb{F}_q[G]\) is defined as an
  \(\mathbb{F}_q\)-linear space of all formal sums
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:algebra-element}
    x\equiv \sum_{g\in G}x_g g,\quad x_g\in \mathbb{F}_q,
  \end{align}
  where group elements \(g\in G\) serve as basis vectors,
  equipped with the product naturally associated with the group
  operation,
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:FG-product}
    ab=\sum_{g\in G}\biggl(\sum_{h\in G} a_h b_{h^{-1}g}\biggr) g, \quad a,b\in \mathbb{F}_q[G].
  \end{align}

  An \(\mathbb{F}_q\)-linear code isomorphic to a \(Z\)-part of the 2BGA code LP\((a,b)\) can be most
  naturally defined as a linear space of pairs
  \((u,v)\in \mathbb{F}_q[G]\times \mathbb{F}_q[G]\) such that
  \begin{align}
    a u+v b=0,
  \end{align}
  with any two pairs \((u,v)\) and \((u',v')\) such that \(u'=u+w b\)
  and \(v'=v-aw\) identified.  The order in the products is relevant
  when the group is non-Abelian.

  \subsection{Examples}

  1. GB codes: For the cyclic group \(\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}\equiv \langle x|x^\ell=1\rangle \),
  any element \(a\) of the group algebra \(\mathbb{F}_q[\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}]\) can be seen as a
  polynomial \(a(x)\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]\) over the group generator \(x\), where the
  polynomial degree deg\(a(x)<\ell\).  The 2BGA code LP\((a,b)\) is just
  a generalized bicycle code GB\([a(x),b(x)]\) constructed from the
  polynomials \(a(x)\) and \(b(x)\) corresponding to
  \(a,b\in \mathbb{F}_q[\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}]\).

  2. Multi-dimensional quantum quasi-cyclic codes: Any finite abelian
  group can be written as a direct product of several cyclic groups,
  e.g., \(G=C_{m_1}\times C_{m_2}\times \ldots C_{m_D}\) for a product
  of \(D\) cyclic groups, which is equivalent to a representation
  \begin{align}
    G=\langle x_1,\ldots,x_D|x_1^{m_1}=x_2^{m_2}=\ldots=x_D^{m_D}\rangle.
  \end{align}
  Respectively, an element of the group algebra \(\mathbb{F}_q[G]\), where \(\mathbb{F}_q\) is
  a finite field, can be written as a \(D\)-variate polynomial in
  \(\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_D]\), with the degree of the generator \(x_j\) of
  order \(m_j\) not exceeding \(m_j-1\).  Thus, any abelian 2BGA code
  can be thought of as a multi-dimensional index-two quasi-cyclic code.
  This includes toric codes and Haah's cubic codes.  An equivalent
  construction in terms of Kronecker products of circulant matrices was
  introduced in \cite{arXiv:1212.6703}.
  Related higher-dimensional
  quasi-cyclic and convolutional quantum codes have been constructed in
  \cite{arxiv:2305.00137}.

  3. Several abelian 2BGA codes with stabilizer generators of weight 6
  have been constructed by Bravyi et al. \cite{arXiv:2308.07915}.  These
  are two-dimensional QC codes which admit time-optimal syndrome
  measurement circuits which can be implemented in a two-layer
  architecture, a generalization of the square-lattice architecture
  optimal for the surface codes.  Circuit simulations show a threshold
  of approximately \(0.8\%\).

  4. Explicit example from \cite{arXiv:2306.16400}: Consider the
  alternating group \(A_4\), also known as the rotation group of a
  regular tetrahedron,
  \begin{align}
    T=\langle x,y|x^3=(yx)^3=y^2=1\rangle,\quad |T|=12,
  \end{align} and the
  binary algebra \(\mathbb{F}_q_2[T]\).  Select \(a=1+x+y+x^{-1}yx\)
  and \(b=1+x+y+yx\) to get an \emph{essentially non-abelian} 2BGA code
  LP\([a,b]\) with parameters \([[24,5,3]]_2\).

protection: |
  Some upper and lower bounds on parameters and many examples of 2BGA codes are given in \cite{arXiv:2306.16400}.
  For a 2BGA code constructed from an abelian group, the code dimension \(k\) is always even \cite{manual:{Kalachev, G. V., and Panteleev, P. A. (2020). On the minimum distance in one class of quantum LDPC codes. Intelligent systems. Theory and applications, 24(4), 87-117.}}.

  rate: |-
    2BGA construction gives some of the best short codes with small stabilizer weights.

    A number of 2BGA codes \([[n,k,d]]_q\) with row weights
    \(W\le 8\), block lengths \(n\le 100\), and parameters such that
    \(kd\ge n\) have been constructed in \cite{arxiv:2306.16400} by
    exhaustive enumeration.  Examples include GB codes with parameters
    \([[70,8,10]]_2\), \([[72,10,9]]_2\), 2BGA codes from abelian groups
    \(\mathbb{Z}_{mh}=\mathbb{Z}_m\times \mathbb{Z}_2\) (index-4 QC codes) with parameters
    \([[48,8,6]]_2\) and \([[56,8,7]]_2\), and non-abelian codes with
    parameters \([[64,8,8]]_2\), \([[82,10,9]]_2\), \([[96,10,12]]_2\),
    and \([[96,12,10]]_2\) (all of these have stabilizer generators of
    weight \(W=8\).)
