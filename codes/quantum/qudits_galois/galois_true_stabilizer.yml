logical: galois

name: 'Galois-qudit true stabilizer code'
#introduced: '\cite{}'

description: |
  Also called a linear stabilizer code. A \([[n,k,d]]_{GF(q)}\) stabilizer code whose stabilizer's symplectic representation forms a linear subspace. In other words, the set of \(q\)-ary vectors representing the stabilizer group is closed under both addition and multiplication by elements of \(GF(q)\). In contrast, Galois-qudit stabilizer codes admit sets of vectors that are closed under addition only.

  The number of generators \(r\) is a multiple of \(m\) (recall that \(q=p^m\) for Galois qudits). As a result, the number \(k=n-r/m\) of logical qudits is an integer.
# Galois qudit codes have lifted stabiilizers, generally k=n-r/m; see Gottesmna's talk

protection: 'Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qudits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qudits.'
