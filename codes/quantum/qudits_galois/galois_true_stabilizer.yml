name: 'True Galois-qudit stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0005008,preset:GottesmanBook}'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{linear stabilizer code}. A \([[n,k,d]]_{GF(q)}\) stabilizer code whose stabilizer's symplectic representation forms a linear subspace. In other words, the set of \(q\)-ary vectors representing the stabilizer group is closed under both addition and multiplication by elements of \(GF(q)\). In contrast, Galois-qudit stabilizer codes admit sets of vectors that are closed under addition only.

  The number of generators \(r\) for a true stabilizer code is a multiple of \(m\) (recall that \(q=p^m\) for Galois qudits). As a result, the number \(k=n-r/m\) of logical qudits is an integer.

  Each code can be represented by a stabilizer generator matrix \(H=(A|B)\), where each row \((a|b)\) is the \(GF(q)\)-valued symplectic representation of a stabilizer generator.

  Since classical length-\(n\) Hermitian self-orthogonal linear codes over \(GF(q^2)\) can be converted into length-\(2n\) symplectic self-orthogonal linear codes over \(GF(q)\) (\cite{doi:10.1002/(SICI)1520-6610(2000)8:3<174::AID-JCD3>3.0.CO;2-T}, Thm. 1), and since symplectic self-orthogonal codes are also trace-symplectic self-orthogonal, true Galois-qudit stabilizer codes can also be constructed from Hermitian self-orthogonal linear codes over \(GF(q^2)\) (first noted in Ref. \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0005008}).
  Many quantum codes have been constructed using this  \textit{Hermitian construction} (e.g., \cite{doi:10.1142/S0219749919500060,doi:10.26421/QIC13.1-2-3,doi:10.1007/s11128-020-02921-0,arxiv:1507.08355,arxiv:1604.05823,arXiv:2007.13309}).
