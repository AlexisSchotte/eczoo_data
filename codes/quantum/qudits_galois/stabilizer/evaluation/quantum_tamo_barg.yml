code_id: quantum_tamo_barg
physical: galois
logical: galois

name: 'Quantum Tamo-Barg (QTB) code'
short_name: 'QTB'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:2311.08653}'

description: |
  A member of a family of Galois-qudit CSS codes whose underlying classical codes consist of Tamo-Barg codes together with specific low-weight codewords.
  Folded versions of QTB codes, or \textit{FQTB codes}, defined on qudits whose dimension depends on \(n\) yield explicit examples of QLRCs of arbitrary locality \(r\) \cite[Thm. 2]{arxiv:2311.08653}.

protection: |
  A family of QTBs can be defined for every prime \(r\), rate \(R\in(0,1)\), and qudit dimension \(q = n+1\) such that their relative distance is \(\delta \geq 1 - \sqrt{(1+R)/2} - O(1/r)\) \cite[Thm. 3]{arxiv:2311.08653}.

  \textit{Folding} these codes by combining qudits into larger qudits yields FQTB codes with relative distance \(\delta \geq (1-R)/2 - O(1/\sqrt{r})\) \cite[Thm. 2]{arxiv:2311.08653} and qudit dimension to \(q = n^{O(r^2)}\).
  This relative distance is of order \(O(1/\sqrt{r})\) below the Singleton-like QLRC bound.

  decoders:
    - 'Polynomially efficient decoder for QTB codes against errors acting on a number of subsystems that can go up to half of their conjectured distance \cite[Thm. 8]{arxiv:2311.08653}.
    The decoder is based on decoding RS codes, and its runtime is independent of the locality \(r\).'
    - 'Polynomially efficient decoder for FQTB codes against errors acting on a number of subsystems that can go up to half of their conjectured distance \cite[Thm. 7]{arxiv:2311.08653}.
    The runtime depends on the locality \(r\).'
