code_id: translationally_invariant_prime_qudit_stabilizer
physical: qudits
logical: qudits

name: 'Translationally invariant prime qudit stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1607.01387}'

description: |
  A generalization of the \ref{code:translationally_invariant_stabilizer} from qubit stabilizer codes to stabilizer codes on qudits
  of prime dimension \(p\), \ref{code:galois_stabilizer}s. A family of stabilizer codes in which the qudits are organized on a lattice
  modeled by the additive group \(\mathbb{Z}^D\) for a spatial dimension \(D\), each lattice point contains a finite number \(q\)
  qubits, and the stabilizer group is translationally invariant with respect to the lattice.
  
  Similar to the qubit case, a single-qudit Pauli operator can be specified by the lattice coordinate of the site and the
  \(\mathbb{F}_p^{2q}\) symplectic vector representation of the Pauli operator within the site. The stabilizer group of the
  translation invariant code is then generated by site-local Pauli operators and their translations. As each lattice coordinate can
  be represented by a Laurent monomial of \(D\) formal variables, the multiplicative group of finitely supported Pauli operators modulo
  phase factors on the lattice of dimension \(D\) with \(q\) qubits per site is isomorphic to the additive group of Laurent polynomial
  column vectors of length \(2q\) in \(D\) formal variables.
