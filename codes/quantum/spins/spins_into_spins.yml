logical: spins

name: 'Spin code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2005.10910}'

description: |
  Encodes \(K\)-dimensional Hilbert space into a \(q^n\)-dimensional (\(n\)-qudit) Hilbert space, where the canonical qudit basis consists of states of a quantum mechanical spin. In other words, canonical single-qudit states \(|^\ell_m\rangle\) are labeled by total angular momentum \(\ell\) (either integer or half-integer) and its \(z\)-axis projection \(m\), with \(q=2\ell+1\).

  In contrast to other qudit codes, spin codes are closely associated with the angular momentum Lie algebra and/or the Lie groups \(SU(2)\) or \(SO(3)\).

  Codespaces are two-dimensional subspaces of a spin''s Hilbert space mapped to themselves using representatives of the binary octahedtral (\(2O\)) group. This is done by restricting the \(SU(2)\) irreducible representation to the \(2O\) representatives.
  The irreducible representations of interest do not appear at all in integer spins, so half-integer spins are used.

protection: 'Protects against errors that take the form of small random \(SU(2)\) representatives. These typically come in the form of dephasing errors, relaxation errors, and thermalization errors.'

features:

  encoders:
    - 'Given any half-integer spin above \(3/2\), explicit codewords can be produced.'
    - 'Producing codewords begins by creating a projection  onto an irreducible representation of \(2O\).'
    - 'Then, irreducible representations of the Paulis \(\bar{\sigma}_w\) are defined using the above projection and the angular momentum operators.'
    - 'Finally, \(|\bar{0} \rangle\) is defined as the \(+1\) eigenvalue of \(\bar{\sigma}_z\) and \(|\bar{1} \rangle = \bar{\sigma}_x |\bar{0} \rangle \).'

  general_gates:
    - 'Universal computation results from being able to prepare a single logical state, perform one measurement, the phase gate, the Hadamard gate, the conditional phase gate, and the square root of the phase gate.'

#notes:
#  - 'The exact error correction condition is \(\langle \bar{0} | J_z | \bar{0} \rangle = 0\)'
