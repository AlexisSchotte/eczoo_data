name: 'Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9512032,doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.793,arXiv:quant-ph/9601029}'

description: |
  An \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code whose stabilizer generators are either \(Z\)-type or \(X\)-type Pauli strings. The parity check matrix is of the form
  \begin{align}
  H=\begin{pmatrix}0 & H_{Z}\\
  H_{X} & 0
  \end{pmatrix}~.
  \label{eq:parity}
  \end{align}

  Encoding is based on two \hyperref[code:binary_linear]{binary linear codes}, an \([n,k_X,d_X]\) code \(C_X\) and \([n,k_Z,d_Z]\) code \(C_Z\) with \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\), such that \(k=k_X+k_Z-n\) and \(d\geq\min\{d_X,d_Z\}\). The \(H_X\) (\(H_Z\)) block of \(H\) \eqref{eq:parity} is associated with the code \(C_X\) (\(C_Z\)), and the requirement \(C_X^\perp \subseteq C_Z\) guarantees that the \(X\)-stabilizers of \(C_X\) commute with the \(Z\)-stabilizers of \(C_Z\).

  A CSS code has \textit{stabilizer weight} \(w\) if the highest weight of any stabilizer generator is \(w\), i.e., any row and column of \(H_X\) and \(H_Z\) has weight at most \(w\). In the context of comparing weight as well as of noise models biased toward \(X\)- or \(Z\)-type errors, an extended notation for CSS codes is \([[n,k,(d_X,d_Z),w]]\).

  There exists a many to one mapping from size three chain complexes to CSS codes first introduced by Bombin and Martin-Delgado \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0605094}. 
  A chain complex of size three is given by binary vector spaces \(C_2\), \(C_1\), \(C_0\) and boundry operators (matrixcies) \(\partial_2\), \(\partial_1\) that satisfy \(\partial_1 \circ \partial_2 = 0\). 
  We can construct a CSS code by associating a physical qubit to every basis element of \(C_1\) and letting the stabilizers \(C_x\) and \(C_z\) be \(Im(\partial_1^T)\) and \(Im(\partial_2)\), respectivley.
  Then the normalizer of the stabilizers \(N(C_x)\) and \(N(C_z)\) are \(Ker(\partial_2^T)\) and \(Ker(\partial_1)\), repectivley.
  The number of encoded logical qubits is equal to the dimension of the first \(Z_2\)-Homology of the chain complex, \(H_1(\partial, Z_2) = \frac{Ker(\partial_1)}{Im(\partial_2)}\). 
  Usually, the chain complex used in this construction comes from the chain complex associated with a cellulation of a manifold.
  When the manifold is a two-dimensional surface we use its entire chain. For larger dimensions, we use the three largest non-trivial vector spaces in its chain.
  The distance of the CSS code is equal to the minimum of the combinatorial (\(d-1\))-systole of the cellulated \(d\)-dimensional manifold and its dual.
  For surfaces there is an upper bound of \(d \leq O(\sqrt(n))\) on the distance, therefore codes coming from higher-dimensional spaces are studied for larger distance.
  Codes constructed in this manner are called Homological codes and capture all CSS codes. For more on Homological codes. \cite{arXiv:1802.01520} '

  Every CSS code can be derived via many different chain complexes \cite{arXiv:1311.0885}. 
  Given a CSS code with parity check matrices \(H_x\) and \(H_y\), let both the boundary operators be \(\partial = H_z^TUH_x\) for an arbitrary invertible matrix \(U\). 
  Then the code derived from a chain with this boundry operator will have stabilizers \(C_x\) and \(C_z\) be \(Im(\partial^T)\) and \(Im(\partial)\), respectivley.

notes: 
  - 'Original requirement of \(C_X^\perp \subset C_Z\) \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9512032} has been relaxed to absorb \hyperref[code:hypergraph_product]{hypergraph product} codes.'

However, any \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code can be mapped onto a \([[4n,2k,2d]]\) weakly self-dual CSS code, with the mapping preserving geometric locality of a code up to a constant factor \cite{arXiv:1004.3791}.'
