logical: qudits


name: 'Movassagh-Ouyang Hamiltonian Codes'

introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2012.01453}'

description: 'This is a family of codes derived via an algorithm that takes as input \textit{any} classical code and outputs a quantum code. The algorithm is probabalistic but succeeds with high probability (almost surely if the classical code is random). This family of codes strictly generalizes CSS codes (because CSS codes come only from linear or self orthogonal classical codes). This family of codes is not a subset of stabilizer codes nor are stabilizer codes a subset of this family. This family of codes can be shown to be realized as a subspace of the ground space of a (geometrically) local Hamiltonian (and so they can be considered quantum LDPC codes).'

protection: 'Let \(C \subset \{0,1,\dots,q-1\}^n\) be a classical code with distance \(d_x\). Let \(d_z\) satisfy \(q^n > 2 V_q(d_z-1) -1\) where \(V_q(r)\) is the volume of the \(q\)-ary Hamming ball of radius \(r\). Then the algorithm produces a quantum code with distance \(d = \text{min}(d_x,d_z)\). Asymptotically, the distance scales linearly with \(n\).'

  - 'If the probabilistic algorithm fails, it is still possible to create an approximate quantum error correcting code.'
  - 'This framework works for qudits as well, but is more easily stated for qubits.'
