description: |
  A class of quantum error-correcting codes that generalize Floquet codes (in a sense that periodicity is not needed),  whose sequence of measurements implements logical gates in addition to performing error detection. Floquet codes are periodic examples of DA codes.
  However, aperiodic measurement sequences provide a way to implement logical gates, which come from the automorphism group of the instantaneous stabilizer group (ISG) at some rounds, i.e. of the effective code at those rounds.
  Known examples of DA codes include all known Floquet codes, but also the 2D (3D) DA color codes, which at certain measurement rounds realize the ISG of 2D (3D) color codes, and can implement Clifford (non-Clifford) gates during their evolution by measurements, respectively.

features:
general_gates:
   -  ‘The measurement sequences of the 2D DA color code on a \(N\) layers of triangular patches (which encodes \(N\) logical qubits) can be used to implement all Clifford logical gates via a sequence of two- and more rarely three-qubit measurements.’
    - ‘The 3D DA color code allows for a non-Clifford logical gate via adaptive two-qubit measurements.’
