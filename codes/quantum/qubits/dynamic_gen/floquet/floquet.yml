code_id: floquet
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Hasting-Haah Floquet code'
short_name: 'Floquet'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2107.02194}'

description: |
  Dynamically-generated stabilizer-based code whose logical qubits are generated through a particular sequence of check-operator measurements such that the number of logical qubits is larger than when the code is viewed as a static subsystem stabilizer code.

  After each measurement in the sequence, the codespace is a joint \(+1\) eigenspace of an \textit{instantaneous stabilizer group (ISG)}, i.e., a particular stabilizer group corresponding to the measurement. The ISG specifies the state of the system as a Pauli stabilizer state at a particular round of measurement, and it evolves into a (potentially) different ISG depending on the check operators measured in the next step in the sequence.
  As opposed to subsystem codes, only specific measurement sequences maintain the codespace.

  Measurements of Floquet codes based on topological phases can be interpreted as causing anyon \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensation} (i.e., code switching), thereby mapping the topological phase of a given code state into another condensed phase.
  In this way, measurements cycle logical quantum information between various \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensed phases} of a single \textit{parent topological phase} \cite{arxiv:2212.00042}.

protection: 'Protects against single-qubit Pauli noise and check operator measurement errors.'

    - code_id: dynamic_gen
      detail: 'Floquet code state initialization and error correction is done by a sequence of different (usually weight-two) stabilizer measurements.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: subsystem_stabilizer
      detail: 'This code can be viewed as a subsystem stabilizer code, albeit one with less logical qubits.'
    - code_id: monitored_random_circuits
      detail: 'Both Floquet and monitored random circuit codes can have an instantaneous stabilizer group which evolves through unitary evolution and measurements. However, Floquet codewords are generated via a specific sequence of measurements, while random-circuit codes maintain a stabilizer group after any measurement. Floquet codes have the additional capability of detecting errors induced during the measurement process; see Appx. A of Ref. \cite{arxiv:2107.02194}.'
