logical: qubits

name: 'Hybrid stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:0802.2414,arxiv:1701.06963}'

description: |
  A qubit stabilizer code which stores both quantum and classical information.
  Usually denoted as \([[n,k:c]]\) or \([[n,k:c,d]]\), where \(k\) (\(c\)) is the number of encoded qubits (classical bits), and where \(d\) is the distance.

  The algebraic structure of a hybrid stabilizer code is the same as that of a USt code whose cosets are indexed by a linear binary code:
  both codes utilize codewords of an inner \([[n,k]]\) qubit stabilizer code \(\mathsf{C}\) and its cosets \(t \mathsf{C}\) by \(2^c\) Pauli strings \(t\), with the coset index \(t\) corresponding to a codeword of the outer \([n,c]\) linear binary code.
  However, the hybrid stabilizer code does not utilize superpositions of codewords of \(t \mathsf{C}\) and \(t^{\prime} \mathsf{C}\) for \(t \neq t^{\prime}\).
  As such, a hybrid stabilizer code can be thought of as a particular USt code some of whose qubits are used for storing classical information.
