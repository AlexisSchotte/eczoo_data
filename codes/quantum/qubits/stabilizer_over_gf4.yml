name: 'Stabilizer code over \(GF(4)\)'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9608006}'

description: |
  An \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code constructed from a quaternary classical code using the one-to-one correspondence between the four Pauli matrices \(\{I,X,Y,Z\}\) and the four elements \(\{0,1,\alpha^2,\alpha\}\) of the quaternary field \(GF(4)\).

  An \(n\)-qubit Pauli stabilizer can be represented as a length-\(n\) quaternary vector. The stabilizer commutation condition corresponds to a zero trace-Hermitian inner product between the corresponding vectors. Stabilizer codes over \(GF(4)\) can thus be constructed from classical trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive quaternary codes and Hermitian self-orthogonal linear quaternary codes (since the latter are automatically trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal).
  The classical code corresponds to the stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\) while its trace-Hermitian dual corresponds to the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\).

  Stabilizer codes over \(GF(4)\) can be constructed as follows. Let \(\phi\) be a bijection from a linear binary subspace to \(GF(4)^n\). Let \(C\) be a trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive subcode over \(GF(4)\), containing \(2^{n-k}\) vectors, such that there are no vectors of weight less than \(d\) in \(C^{\perp}\setminus C\). Then, any eigenspace of the inverse map \(\phi^{-1}(C)\) is an \([[n, k, d]]\) stabilizer code over \(GF(4)\).

#  The quaternary code needs to only be additive (its codewords are closed under addition). It need not be a linear code, which would require the set of codewords to be closed under multiplication as well.

      detail: 'The stabilizer commutation condition for stabilizer codes over \(GF(4)\) can equivalently be stated in the representation of stabilizers as quaternary vectors. A pair of \(n\)-qubit stabilizers commute iff the trace-Hermitian inner product of their corresponding vectors is zero. Stabilizer codes over \(GF(4)\) can thus be constructed from trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive quaternary codes.'
    - code_id: dual
      detail: 'If the classical additive code of quaternary vectors corresponding a stabilizer code over \(GF(4)\) is linear, then the code is self-orthogonal with respect to both the trace-Hermitian and Hermitian inner products (\cite{doi:10.1201/9781315147901}, Thm. 27.4.1). In other words, the extra trace operation can be removed from the definition of inner product.'
