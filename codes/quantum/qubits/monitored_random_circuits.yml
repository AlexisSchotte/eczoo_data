description: 'A monitored random circuit is described by a series of intermittant random local projective Pauli measurements with random unitary time evolution operators. When the rate of projective measurements is independently controlled by a probability parameter p, there exist two stable phases, one described by the volume-law entanglement entropy and the other described by area-law entanglement entropy. This entanglement phase transition has been shown to be equivalent to the purification transition when starting in an mixed initial state \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}. The phase transition can be understood from the perspective of quantum error correction, information scrambling and channel capacities as discussed in \cite{arXiv:1903.05124,arXiv:1905.05195}. The quantum channel capacity of monitored random circuits quantifies the amount of quantum informatino stored in the system \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}. When \( p = 0 \), the random circuit has a finite information capacity that decays on a timescale exponential in system size \cite{arXiv:arxiv:1905.05195} (CHECK). This notion quantifies the recoverability of information and the reversability of the system under the monitored random dynamics. In the area-law phase, \( (p > p_c)\), the density of the channel capasity converges to zero  (ie, irreverable) while in the volume law phase, \( p , p_c \), the channel capacity remains non-zero (ie, reversable). In the reversable regime, the monitored channel randomly projects the state into a quantum error correcting code space \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}. \textbf{Clifford monitored random circuits}: When considering unitary evolutions, it can be useful to condier unitaries randomly sampled from the Clifford group such that the series of time evolved Pauli operators are always Pauli operators, by definition of the Clifford group. In this case, the time-evolved projective measurement at time step \(j\) is given by \( P_j = U_{\tau} \cdots U_j P_j^’ (U_{\tau} \cdots U_j)^{\dagger} \). Thus the monitored random circuit just implements a series of projective measurements at various time steps.'

protection: 'When in the volume-law phase, protects against random projective measurements at a rate \( p < p_c \). While the true code distance is not known, it is conjectured to be proportional to the contiguous distance. As first described in \cite{1905.05195}, the  contiguous distance for these circuits is defined with respect to all partitions of the system.'

# OLD VERSION 'When in the volume-law phase, protects against random projective measurements at a rate \( p < p_c \). As described in \cite{1905.05195} and \cite{2105.13352} the subleading contribution to the entropy can be interpreted as the code distance and is given by \(d_{\rm code} = L^{\gamma_{code}} \) where \( \gamma_{code} \approx 0.38 \) and \( L \) is the size of the system. For a monitored circuit in the volume law-phase with an exponentially long memory time, \( d \leq Poly(n) \).'

features:

  rate: 'Finite rate \cite{arXiv:2007.03822}. Can think of as a stabilizer code whose parameters depend on time, \( [[n,k(t),d(t)]] \)'


  encoders:
    - 'The dynamics of the monitored random circuit can be recast in the language of stabilizer codes \cite{arXiv:1903.05124}. The stabilizers of the monitored Clifford circuit can be recursively defined as \( Stab^{(t)} = \langle P_{\tau}, Stab^{( \tau - 1)} \rangle \). The number of stabilizers increases if and only if the next Pauli \( P_{\tau+1} \) commutes with the operators in \( Stab^{\tau} \) . If not, then the Pauli operators which do not commute with  \( P_{\tau} \) are removed and \( P_{\tau} \) is added. The likelihood of randomly generating a \( P_{\tau} \) which commutes with all the Pauli’s in the stabilizer is low when the stabilizer group is already large (at entanglement equilibrium).'
    - '(CHECK) The initial state preparation is the encoding operation while the subsequent measurements and control are the decoding operation'
    - ' Can construct optimal single copy encoding operations for strong purification transitions\cite{arXiv:1905.05195}'

  threshold:
    - 'Above the critical measurement rate \( p_c\), the natural error correction properties of the circuit can no longer protect the information. This can be interpreted as the code threshold.'
    - 'These dynamically generated codes saturate the trade off between density of encoded information and the error rate threshold \cite{arXiv:1905.05195}'

  - 'Measurement induced quantum phases have been realized in trapped-ion processor \cite{arXiv:2106.05881}'

notes:
  - 'Connections to information scrambling in black hole physics as introduced in Section 11 of \cite{arXiv:1903.05124}. In particular, monitored random circuits can be viewed as the Hayden-Preskill recovery problem \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevD.100.086001} running backwards in time. In this setting, the volume-law entanglement phase of the monitored circuit is describes the phase when information can be recovered from an old black hole (ie, a black hole that is maximally entangled with the early universe).
