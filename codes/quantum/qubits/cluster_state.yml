name: 'Cluster-state code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0004051,arxiv:quant-ph/0510135,arxiv:quant-ph/0610082}'

description: |
  Qubit stabilizer code used in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), which substitutes the temporal dimension necessary for decoding with a spatial dimension by encoding the computation into the geometry of a resource cluster state.

  Cluster states \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0004051} are stabilizer states defined on a graph, with one stabilizer generator \(S_v\) per vertex \(v\) of the form
  \begin{align}
    S_v = X_{v} \prod_{w\in N(v)} Z_w~,
  \end{aling}
  where the neighborhood \(N(v)\) is the set of vertices which share an edge with \(v\).

  The original MBQC scheme \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0510135,arxiv:quant-ph/0610082} uses the three-dimensional RBH cluster state on the bcc lattice out of the 2D surface code (equivalently, a cubic lattice with qubits on edges and faces).
  More generally, an MBQC scheme can be constructed out of any qubit CSS code (via \textit{clusterization} \cite{arxiv:1607.02579}) or qubit stabilizer code \cite{arxiv:1811.11780}.

features:
  encoding:
    - 'Initialization of all qubits in the \(|+\rangle\) state and action of \(CZ\) gates along the edges of the graph. In the MBQC scheme, the computational gate sequence is encoded in the geometry of the state''s graph.'

  general_gates:
    - 'The computation encoded in pre-determined fashion via the cluster state''s underlying geometry. For the case of the original scheme, qubits may be encoded in 2D defects along slices of the surface code, and Clifford gates are encoded by spatially braiding the defects along the 3rd dimension. Non-Clifford gates are performed by inserting non-Clifford states into particular \textit{singular} qubits.

    To perform the computation, qubits along the extra dimension are measured, e.g., along one two-dimensional slice per time step.
    This effectively teleports the logical information into the remaining unmeasured portion of the cluster state.
    The computation terminates after all qubits are measured.'

features:
  decoders:
    - 'MBQC Syndrome extraction is performed by multiplying certain single-qubit measurements, which yield syndrome values.'


# Do only local measurements, X in the bulk (vacuum V)
# Multiply outcomes to get stabilizers XXXXXX on cube, which is the same as product of cluster state stabs on a cube since Z's cancel
# This diagnoses for Z errors
#
# Z-type error correction round measures Z in the bulk (defect D), which yields ZZZZZZ when multiplied together on a cube
# This diagnoses for X errors

# 3D cluster state has anyonic strings

# Logical info is no desctroyed, but teleported layer by layer along the third direction

# Storage capacity depends upon the topology of the code surface
#   Rough/smooth boundaries
#   Tori = 2 qubits
#   Planes with two holes = 1 qubit
# Gates consist of building a 3D lattice in which holes are twisted. Cluster state is using 3rd spatial dim for a temporal one.
# Lattice surgery also can be scaffolded in.

# So information is effectively stored near the boundary of the 2D slice. Measuring slice by slice will teleport it to the next slice.


code_capacity_threshold:
   - 'Independent \(X,Z\) noise: \(p_X = 2.9\%\) under MWPM decoding \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0510135}.
   The threshold under ML decoding corresponds to the value of critical point of the 3D random-plaquette \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) gauge theory (3D-RPGM) via the statistical mechanical mapping \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143}, calculated to be \(3.3 \%\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0401101} (see also \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0501372}).'
