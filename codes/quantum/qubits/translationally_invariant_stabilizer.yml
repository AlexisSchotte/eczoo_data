name: 'Translationally invariant stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1607.01387}'

description: |
  A family of stabilizer codes in which the qubits are organized on a lattice modeled by the additive group \(\mathbb{Z}^D\) for
  spatial dimension \(D\), each lattice point contains a finite number \(q\) qubits, and the stabilizer group is translationally
  invariant with respect to the lattice.
  
  A single-qubit Pauli operator can be specified by its lattice coordinate of the site and its \(\mathbb{F}_2^{2q}\) symplectic vector
  representation of the Pauli operator within the site. The stabilizer group of the translation invariant code is then generated by
  site-local Pauli operators and their translations. As each lattice coordinate can be represented by a Laurent monomial of \(D\)
  formal variables, the multiplicative group of finitely supported Pauli operators modulo phase factors on the lattice of dimension
  \(D\) with \(q\) qubits per site is isomorphic to the additive group of Laurent polynomial column vectors of length \(2q\) in \(D\)
  formal variables.
  
  As an example, \(P(1, 2, 3; e_1)P(-1, 2, 4; e_{q+2})\) is the Pauli operator that applies \(X\) to qubit \(1\) of
  lattice point \((1, 2, 3)\) and applies \(Z\) to qubit \(2\) of lattice point \((-1, 2, 4)\). This operator can be equivalently
  expressed by the Laurent polynomial \(x_1x_2^2x_3^3e_1 + x_1^{-1}x_2^2x_3^4e_{q+2}\).
  
  For \(D = 2\), translationally invariant stabilizer code Hamiltonians with topological order are equivalent to multiple copies of the
  toric code\cite{arXiv:1812.11193}.
  
  For \(D = 3\), translationally invariant stabilizer code Hamiltonians with topological order can be characterized by four coarse
  classes\cite{arXiv:1908.08049}:
  
  1. Topological quantum field theory: Excitations are mobile in all 3 dimensions. Such codes are conjectured to be equivalent to
  multiple copies of the 3D toric code.
  
  2. Foliated type-I: Excitations are mobile in less than 3 dimensions, but codes can be grown by "foliation"â€”stacking copies of the 2D
  toric code.
  
  3. Fractal type-I: Excitations are mobile in less than 3 dimensions, and codes are not foliated.
  
  4. Type-II: Excitations are not mobile in any dimension.
