logical: qubits

name: 'Four-dimensional hyperbolic code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1310.5555}'

description: |
  There exists \(\epsilon\), a four-dimensional hyperbolic manifold \(M\) and a sequence of manifolds \(M_i\) such that
  each \(M_i\) is a finite sheeted \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space}{covering} of \(M\) and the four-dimensional volumes of the manifolds \(Vol_4(M_i)\) of the sequence tend to infinity. 
  Also, the dimension of the second homology and size of systoles are bounded by \(H_2(M_i, Z_2) \geq \frac{Vol_4(M_i)}{100}\) and \(Sys_2(M_i) \geq Vol_4(M_i)^\epsilon\), respectively.
  
  Given a cellulation of \(M\), it can naturally be extended to cellulations for each of the manifolds \(M_i\). 
  Now, these cellulations can be used to define CSS codes via the homological construction by choosing the size three chain complex consisting of the \(3,2\) and \(1\)-cells of the cellulated \(M_i\).
  
  The number of physical qubits for these codes \(n\) will scale with the volume of the manifolds. 
  Consequently, the number of physical \(k\) qubits and distance \(d\) of the code will scale as \(\Omega(n)\) and \(\Omega(n^\epsilon)\). 
  See the entry on CSS codes for the relationship between properties of manifolds and CSS codes derived from their cellulation.

# Defn of CSS has been changed to accomodate this... In contrast to the original CSS construction there are no restrictions on the form of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'
