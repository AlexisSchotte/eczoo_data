  Guth and Lubotzky give an existential proof for a family of LDPC codes with linear rate based on cellulations of four-dimensional manifolds. 
  These manifolds are shown to have good homology and systolic properties for the purposes of code construction.

  In particular, they show that there exists \(\epsilon\), a four-dimensional hyperbolic manifold \(M\) and a sequence of manifolds \(M_i\) such that
  each \(M_i\) is a finite sheeted \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_space}{covering} of \(M\) and the four-dimensional volumes of the manifolds \(Vol_4(M_i)\) of the sequence tend to infinity. 
  Also, the dimension of the second homology and size of systoles are bounded by \(H_2(M_i, Z_2) \geq \frac{Vol_4(M_i)}{100}\) and \(Sys_2(M_i) \geq Vol_4(M_i)^\epsilon\), respectively.
  
  Then given any cellulation of \(M\), it can naturally be extended to cellulations for each of the manifolds \(M_i\) and used to define CSS codes via the homological construction by choosing the size three chain complex consisting of the \(3,2\) and \(1\)-cells of the cellulations.
  
  For dense cellulations (i.e. large \(n\)) the number of physical qubits for these codes will scale with the volume of the manifolds.
  Therefore, bounds on the dimension of the second homology and size of systoles are achieved in terms of \(n\) for large \(n\).

# Defn of CSS has been changed to accomodate this... In contrast to the original CSS construction there are no restrictions on the form of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).'

protection: 'The number of physical \(k\) qubits and distance \(d\) of the code will scale as \(\Omega(n)\) and \(\Omega(n^\epsilon)\). See the entry on CSS codes for the relationship between properties of manifolds and CSS codes derived from their cellulation.'
