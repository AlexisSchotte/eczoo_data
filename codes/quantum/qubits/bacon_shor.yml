physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Bacon-Shor code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012340}' #Shor's paper: doi: 10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493


description: 'A subsytem code defined on a\(2D\) lattice with the parameters \([n^2,1,n]\) and on a \(3D\) lattice with the parameters \([n^3,1,n]\) motivated by Hamiltonians defined on square and cubic lattices with anisotropic spin-spin interactions. The shortest [9,1,3] Bacon-Shor code has 6 gauge operators, symmetric in both X and Z, as compared to the 8 stabilizers of Shor''s \([9,1,3]\) code.'
# I'd like to define these so that they include code_id:quantum_parity, which means that this entry needs to include the asymmetric 2D bacon-shor codes [[m_1 m_2, 1, \min(m_1, m_2)]]. Ted Yoder's thesis describes these pretty well: https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/115680. I suppose you could generalize the 3D case to asymmetric blocks as well, but this is not necessary.

protection: 'Detects errors on \(n-1\) qubits, corrects errors on \(\left\lfloor (n-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) qubits where \(n^2\) and \(n^3\) are the number of physical qubits in the 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional cases respectively. '


#Please mention briefly fault-tolerance, gates (general and transversal), and threshold info. Thesis does a good job of listing these on pg. 97: https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/115680. Relevant papers are https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01686, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11317.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.1400.pdf
features:
  rate: 'A non-LDPC family of Bacon-Shor codes achieves a distance of (\Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})) with sparse gauge operators.' #(This is alongside any other things you find regarding rate in Ted's thesis.)
