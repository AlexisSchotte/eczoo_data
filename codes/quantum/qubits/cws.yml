name: 'Codeword stabilized (CWS) code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0508131}'

description: 'This family of codes strictly generalizes stabilizer codes. They are usually denoted by \( \mathcal{Q} = (\mathcal{G},\mathcal{C}) \) where \(\mathcal{G}\) is a graph and \(\mathcal{C}\) is a \( (n,K,d) \) binary classical code. From the graph we can form the unique graph state (stabilizer state) \( |G \rangle \). From the classical code we can form the word operators \( W_i = Z^{c_{i,1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes Z^{c_{i,n}} \) where \(c_{i,j} \) is the \(j\)-th bit of the \(i\)-th classical codeword. We then form the quantum codewords of our CWS code as \( | i \rangle =  W_i | G \rangle \).'

protection: 'The distance of a CWS code \(\mathcal{Q} = ( \mathcal{G},\mathcal{C}) \) is upper bounded by the distance of the classical code \(\mathcal{C} \).'

  encoders: 
    - 'If \( \mathcal{C} \) has an efficient classical encoder then so does the CWS code \( \mathcal{Q} = (\mathcal{G},\mathcal{C}) \).'

# realizations:
  # # List and explain the different "domains" of realizations in list items.
  # # Group closely related realizations into a single item. It's OK to have a
  # # single list item. Each item should more or less correspond to what would be
  # # said in a paragraph.

notes:
  - 'There is an alternative description to the one above that is locally Clifford-equivalent. In particular we can describe CWS codes as \( \mathcal{Q} = (S,\mathcal{W})\) where \(S\) is a stabilizer (that is, an abelian subgroup of the Pauli group not containing \(-I\) ) and \( \mathcal{W} = \{ w_\ell \}_{\ell = 1}^K \) is a family of \(K\), \(n\)-qubit Pauli elements. We then form CWS codeswords as \( | i \rangle = w_i | S \rangle \) where \( | S \rangle \) is the (unique) stabilizer state of \(S\).'
  - 'If the family \( \mathcal{W} \) form an abelian group not containing \(-I\) then the code \(\mathcal{Q}\) is a stabilizer code.'
