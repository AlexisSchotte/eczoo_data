code_id: kitaev_honeycomb
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Kitaev honeycomb code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438,arxiv:1701.05052}'

description: 'Code whose logical subspace is labeled by different fusion outcomes of Ising anyons present in the non-Abelian topological phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model \cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0506438}.
Each logical qubit is constructed out of four Majorana operators, which admit braiding-based gates due to their non-Abelian statistics and which can be used for topological quantum computation.'

      detail: 'While the Kitaev honeycomb model is bosonic, a fermionic mapping is useful for solving and understanding the model. Logical subspace of the Kitaev honeycomb code can be formulated as a joint eigenspace of certain Majorana operators \cite[Sec. 4.1]{arxiv:1701.05052}. Logical Paulis are also be constructed out of Majorana operators.'
    - code_id: topological
      detail: 'Kitaev honeycomb codes utilizes the non-Abelian Ising-anyon topological order phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model \cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0506438}. This phase is also known as a \(p+ip\) superconducting phase \cite{arxiv:1104.5485}.'
