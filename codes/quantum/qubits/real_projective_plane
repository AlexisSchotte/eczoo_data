name: '\(\mathbb{R}P^2\) surface codes'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9810055}'

description: 'A family of surface codes on the non-orientable 2-dimensional compact manifold \(\mathbb{R}P^2\) (in contrast to a genus-\(g\) surface). Whereas genus-\(g\) surface codes require \(2g\) logical qubits, qubit codes on \(\mathbb{R}P^2\) are made from a single logical qubit.'
protection: 'If \(\mathcal{C}\) is a cellulation of \(\mathbb{R}P^2\) then the bit flip distance is the shortest cycle in \(\mathcal{C}\) and the phase flip distance is the shortest cycle in the dual cellulation \(\mathcal{C}^*\).'

features:

  rate: 'The rate is always \(1/n\) where \(n\) is the number of edges of the particular cellulation (since physical qubits are placed on the lattice edge). Note the 1 in the numerator is because \(\mathbb{R}P^2\) codes always use 1 logical qubit.'
