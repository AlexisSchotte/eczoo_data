logical: qubits

name: '\(D\)-dimensional twisted toric code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0602063,arxiv:1608.05089}'

description: |
  Extension of the Kitaev toric code to higher-dimensional lattices with regular or shifted (a.k.a. twisted) boundary conditions.
  Such boundary conditions yields quibit geometries that are tori \(\mathbb{R}^D/\Lambda\), where \(\Lambda\) is an arbitrary \(D\)-dimensional lattice.
  Picking a hypercubic lattice yields the ordinary \(D\)-dimensional toric code.
  It is conjectured that appropriate twisted boundary conditions yield multi-dimensional toric code families with linear distance and logarithmic-weight stabilizer generators \cite{arxiv:1608.05089}.

protection: |
  Some higher-dimensional toric codes protect against burst errors \cite{arxiv:2205.13582}.
