physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Hypersphere product code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1608.05089}'

description: |
  Homological code based on products of hyperspheres.
  The hypersphere product code family has asymptotically diminishing soundness that scales as \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(1/\log (n)^2)\), locality of stabilizer generators scaling as \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(\log n/ \log\log n)\), and distance of order \(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\).
