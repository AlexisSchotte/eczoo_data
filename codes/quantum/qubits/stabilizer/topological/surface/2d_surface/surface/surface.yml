name: 'Kitaev surface code'
introduced: |
  \cite{doi:10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155,doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-5923-8_19,arxiv:quant-ph/9707021}

alternative_names:
  - 'Kitaev toric code'

description: |
  A family of Abelian topological \hyperref[code:css]{CSS stabilizer} codes
  whose generators are few-body \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type Pauli strings
  associated to the stars and plaquettes, respectively, of a cellulation of a
  two-dimensional surface (with a qubit located at each edge of the
  cellulation).
  Codewords correspond to ground states of the surface code Hamiltonian, and error operators create or annihilate pairs of anyonic charges or vortices.

  \textit{Toric code} often either refers to the construction on
  the two-dimensional torus or is an alternative name for the general construction.
  \textit{Twisted toric code} \cite[Fig. 8]{arxiv:2012.09271} refers to the construction on a torus with twisted (a.k.a. shifted) boundary conditions.
  The construction on surfaces with boundaries is often called the
  \textit{planar code} \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9810055,arxiv:quant-ph/9811052}.
  There are two types of stabilizers one can put on edges, yielding \textit{open} (a.k.a. rough) and \textit{closed} (a.k.a. smooth) boundaries.
  A \textit{mixed boundary} consists of an interleaving of the two stabilizer types \cite{arxiv:1606.07116}.

  The stabilizers of the surface code on the 2-dimensional torus are generated
  by star operators \(A_v\) and plaquette operators \(B_p\).  Each star operator
  is a product of four Pauli-\(X\) operators on the edges adjacent to a vertex
  \(v\) of the lattice; each plaquette operator is a product of four Pauli-\(Z\)
  operators applied to the edges adjacent to a face, or plaquette, \(p\) of the
  lattice (\ref{figure:toric-code-operators}).

  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{toric-code-operators}
    \caption{Stabilizer generators and logical operators of the 2D surface
      code on a torus.  The star operators \(A_v\) and the plaquette operators
      \(B_p\) generate the stabilizer group of the toric code.  The logical
      operators are strings that wrap around the torus.}
    \label{figure:toric-code-operators}
  \end{figure}

  The two-dimensional toric code encodes two logical qubits.  We denote by
  \(\overline{X}_i,\overline{Z}_i\) the logical Pauli-\(X\) and Pauli-\(Z\)
  operator of the \(i\)-th logical qubit.  They can are represented by strings
  of Pauli-\(X\) operators or Pauli-\(Z\) operators that wrap around the torus
  as shown in \ref{figure:toric-code-operators}.

protection: |
  Toric code on an \(L\times L\) torus is a \([[2L^2,2,L]]\) CSS code.
  The original planar code on a square-lattice patch with different boundary conditions on the vertical and horizontal edges is a \([[L^2+(L-1)^2,1,L]]\) CSS code \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9810055}.
  Code size \(k = 2^{2g}\) for a torus of genus \(g\), and such higher genus surfaces have been investigated \cite{arxiv:2307.04418}.

  Coherent physical errors are expected to become incoherent logical errors under syndrome measurement; see corroborating numerical studies performed via the Majorana mapping \cite{arxiv:1710.02270} as well as analytical bounds \cite{arxiv:1912.04319}.

features:
  rate: |
    Both the planar and toric codes saturate the \hyperref[topic:bpt-bound]{BPT bound}, which states that \(k d^2 = O(L^2)\) for codes on a 2D lattice of length \(O(L)\).
