logical: qubits

name: 'Hyperbolic color code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1301.6588,arxiv:1804.06382,arxiv:1906.11394}'

description: |
  An extension of the color code construction to hyperbolic manifolds.
  As opposed to there being only three types of three-valent and three-colorable lattice tilings in the 2D Euclidean plane, there is an infinite number of admissible hyperbolic tilings in the 2D hyperbolic plane \cite{arxiv:1804.06382}.
  Certain double covers of hyperbolic tilings also yield admissible tilings \cite{arxiv:1301.6588}.
  Tilings in \(D \geq 3\) dimensions can be obtained using a construction based on the  more general quantum pin codes \cite{arxiv:1906.11394}.


protection: |
  The use of hyperbolic surfaces allows one to circumvent bounds on code parameters (such as the \term{BPT bound}) that are valid for lattice geometries.
  Hyperbolic color codes can have high rate but tend to have small distance.
  For example, a \(\{4g,4g\}\) tiling with periodic boundary conditions (i.e., a \(g\)-torus) yields a \([[4g+8,4g,4]]\) code family \cite{arxiv:1804.06382}.
  More examples, such as the \([[160,20,8]]\) code on the 4.10.10 tiling, are provided in \cite[Sec. V.A]{arxiv:1906.11394}.

features:
  rate: 'In the double-cover construction \cite{arxiv:1301.6588}, an \(\{\ell,m\} input tiling yields a code family with an asymptotic rate of \(1 - 1/\ell - 1/m\).'
