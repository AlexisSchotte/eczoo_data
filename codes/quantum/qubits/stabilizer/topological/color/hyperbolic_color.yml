name: 'Hyperbolic color code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1301.6588,arxiv:1804.06382,arxiv:1906.11394}'

description: |
  An extension of the color code construction to hyperbolic manifolds.
  As opposed to there being only three types of uniform three-valent and three-colorable lattice tilings in the 2D Euclidean plane, there is an infinite number of admissible hyperbolic tilings in the 2D hyperbolic plane \cite{arxiv:1804.06382}.
  Certain double covers of hyperbolic tilings also yield admissible tilings \cite{arxiv:1301.6588}.
  Other admissible hyperbolic tilings can be obtained via a fattening procedure \cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0607736}; see also a construction based on the  more general quantum pin codes \cite{arxiv:1906.11394}.
  See Ref. \cite{arxiv:2310.16982} for surface codes on quasi-hyperbolic manifolds.

protection: |
  The use of hyperbolic surfaces allows one to circumvent bounds on code parameters (such as the \term{BPT bound}) that are valid for lattice geometries.
  Hyperbolic color codes can have high rate but tend to have small distance.
  For example, a \(\{4g,4g\}\) tiling with periodic boundary conditions (i.e., a \(g\)-torus) yields a \([[4g+8,4g,4]]\) code family \cite{arxiv:1804.06382}.
  More examples, such as the \([[160,20,8]]\) code on the 4.10.10 tiling, are provided in \cite[Sec. V.A]{arxiv:1906.11394}.

  There exists a family with rate of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(1/\log n)\) and minimum distance of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(\Omega(\log n)\) which supports fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates \cite{arxiv:2310.16982}.
  A construction based on the Torelli mapping yields a code with constant rate with similar gates \cite{arxiv:2310.16982}.

features:
  rate: 'In the double-cover construction \cite{arxiv:1301.6588}, an \(\{\ell,m\}\) input tiling yields a code family with an asymptotic rate of \(1 - 1/\ell - 1/m\). A construction based on the Torelli mapping yields a code with constant rate with similar gates \cite{arxiv:2310.16982}.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'There exists a family with rate of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(O(1/\log n)\) and minimum distance of \hyperref[topic:asymptotics]{order} \(\Omega(\log n)\) which supports fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates \cite{arxiv:2310.16982}. A construction based on the Torelli mapping yields a code with constant rate with similar gates \cite{arxiv:2310.16982}.'
