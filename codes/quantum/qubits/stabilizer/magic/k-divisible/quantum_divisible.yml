description: |
  A level-\(\nu\) quantum divisible code is a CSS code whose \(X\)-type stabilizers form a \(\nu\)-even linear binary code in the \hyperref[topic:binary-symplectic-representation]{symplectic representation} and which admits a transversal gate at the \(\nu\)th level of the \term{Clifford hierarchy}.
  A CSS code is \textit{doubly even} (\textit{triply even}) if all \(X\)-type stabilizers have weight divisible by four (eight), i.e., if they form a doubly even (triply even) linear binary code.

  The definition can be generalized to \textit{weakly} \(\nu\)-\textit{divisible} (see, e.g., Ref. \cite{arxiv:2408.12752}), which means that there exist some disjoint qubit subsets \(M^{\pm}\) such that 
  \begin{align}
    | x \cap M^{+} | - | x \cap M^{-} | \equiv 0 \mod \nu
  \end{align}
  for all rows \(x\) of the code's \(X\)-type stabilizer generator matrix.
  CSS codes satisfying the above with \(\nu = 2\) (\(\nu = 4\), \(\nu = 8\)) are called \textit{weak even} (\textit{weak doubly even}, \textit{weak triply even}).
  This generalization reduces to the original definition when \(M^{+}\) is the full set of qubits, and \(M^{-}\) the empty set.

  An alternative definition \cite{arxiv:2109.13481,arxiv:2204.13176}, not used here, is a CSS code defined from two linear binary codes \(C_{1,2}\) such that it is quantum divisible with \(\nu > 1\), and all weights in each coset of \(C_2\) in \(C_1\) are congruent to \(\nu\).
  For example \cite{arxiv:2204.13176}, if \(C_2\) is the first-order RM\((1,m)\) code, and \(C_1/ C_2\) consists of quadratic forms with a bounded rank, then \([[n = 2m − 1, 1 \leq k \leq 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{m-4}(m − i), d = 3]]\) is a family of such codes.

features:
  transversal_gates:
    - 'Doubly even codes can yield a transversal \(S\) gate, while triply even codes yield a logical \(T\) gate for odd \(n\) via physical action of \(T\) gates on each qubit \cite{arxiv:1509.03239}.'
    - 'If the \(X\)-type stabilizers of a CSS code form an \(\nu\)-even classical code, and if all \(X\)-type logicals are \((\nu-1)\)-even, then the code admits a diagonal transversal gate in the \(\nu\)th level of the \term{Clifford hierarchy} \cite[Prop. 8]{arxiv:1906.11394}.'


  general_gates:
    - 'The \([[2m − 1, 1 \leq k \leq 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{m-4}(m − i), 3]]\) quantum divisible code family can serve as outer codes of either the five-qubit \([[5,1,3]]\) or Steane \([[7,1,3]]\) code to realize a \(T\) gate on the inner code \cite{arxiv:2204.13176}.
    For example, when \(m=5\) (\(m=6\)), the resulting \([[31,5,3]]\) (\([[63,7,3]]\)) code yields the \(T\) gate on the inner five-qubit (Steane) code.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'The \(T\) gate realized by concatenating members of the \([[2m − 1, 1 \leq k \leq 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{m-4}(m − i), 3]]\) quantum divisible code family with either the five-qubit \([[5,1,3]]\) or Steane \([[7,1,3]]\) code is fault-tolerant and does not require magic-state distillation \cite{arxiv:2204.13176}.
    The gate is performed on the inner five-qubit/Steane code and does require encoding and decoding algorithms to pass between the inner and outer codes.'

realizations:
  - 'Triply even codes can yield secure multi-party quantum computation \cite{arxiv:2206.04871}.'
