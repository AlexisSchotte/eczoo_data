description: |
  An \(((n,2^k,d))\) qubit stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k]]\) or \([[n,k,d]]\), where \(d\) is the code's distance.
  Logical subspace is the joint eigenspace of commuting Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\).
  Traditionally, the logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(2^{n-k}\) commuting Pauli operators which do not contain \(-I\).
  The distance is the minimum weight of a Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.

  \begin{defterm}{Symplectic representation}
  \label{topic:binary-symplectic-representation}
  In the symplectic representation, the single-qubit identity, \(X\), \(Y\), or \(Z\) Pauli matrices represented using two bits as \((0|0)\), \((1|0)\), \((1|1)\), and \((0|1)\), respectively.
  In other words, the single-qubit Pauli string \(X^a Z^b\) is converted to the vector \(a|b\).
  The multi-qubit version follows naturally.
  \end{defterm}

  Each stabilizer code can be represented by a \((n-k) \times 2n\) \textit{check matrix} (a.k.a. \textit{stabilizer generator matrix}) \(H=(A|B)\), where each row \((a|b)\) is the \hyperref[topic:binary-symplectic-representation]{symplectic representation} of an element from a set of generating elements of the stabilizer group.
  The check matrix can be brought into standard form via Gaussian elimination \cite{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511976667}.

  A pair of \(n\)-qubit stabilizers with \hyperref[topic:binary-symplectic-representation]{symplectic representation} \((a|b)\) and \((a^{\prime}|b^{\prime})\) commute iff their symplectic inner product is zero,
  \begin{align}
    a \cdot b^{\prime} + a^{\prime}\cdot b = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j b^{\prime}_j + a^{\prime}_i b_i = 0~.
  \end{align}
  The set of all binary symplectic vectors form a symplectic self-orthogonal binary linear code of length \(2n\).

  Another correspondence between qubit Pauli matrices and elements of the \hyperref[topic:finite-fields]{quaternary Galois field} \(GF(4)\) yields the one-to-one correspondence between qubit stabilizer codes and trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive quaternary codes.

  \begin{defterm}{\(GF(4)\) representation}
  \label{topic:gf4-representation}
  An \(n\)-qubit Pauli stabilizer can be represented as a length-\(n\) quaternary vector using the one-to-one correspondence between the four Pauli matrices \(\{I,X,Y,Z\}\) and the four elements \(\{0,1,\omega^2,\omega\}\) of the \hyperref[topic:finite-fields]{quaternary Galois field} \(GF(4)\).
  \end{defterm}

  The sets of \(GF(4)\)-represented vectors for all generators yield a trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive quaternary code.
  This classical code corresponds to the stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\) while its trace-Hermitian dual corresponds to the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\).

  Alternative representations include the \textit{decoupling representation}, in which Pauli strings are represented as vectors over \(GF(2)\) using three bits \cite{arxiv:2305.17505}.

  Qubit stabilizer states can be expressed in terms of linear and quadratic functions over \(\mathbb{Z}_2^n\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0304125}.

# More technically, let \(\phi\) be a bijection from a linear binary subspace to \(GF(4)^n\). Let \(C\) be a trace-Hermitian self-orthogonal additive subcode over \(GF(4)\), containing \(2^{n-k}\) vectors, such that there are no vectors of weight less than \(d\) in \(C^{\perp}\setminus C\). Then, any eigenspace of the inverse map \(\phi^{-1}(C)\) is an \([[n, k, d]]\) stabilizer code over \(GF(4)\).


protection: |
  Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits.

  There is the following analogue of the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions} for qubit stabilizer codes.
  Define the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\) of \(\mathsf{S}\) to be the set of all Pauli operators that commute with all \(S\in\mathsf{S}\).
  A stabilizer code can correct a Pauli error set \({\mathcal{E}}\) if and only if \(E^\dagger F \notin \mathsf{N(S)}\setminus \mathsf{S}\) for all \(E,F \in {\mathcal{E}}\).

  \begin{defterm}{Cleaning lemma}
  \label{topic:cleaning-lemma}
  If all logical operators act trivially on some subset of qubits in a stabilizer code, then any logical Pauli operator can be represented on the complementary qubit subset via a stabilizer.
  More technically, given any subset \(M\) of qubits that is correctable (under erasure), any logical Pauli operator \(P\) can be \textit{cleaned off} of \(M\) using a stabilizer \(S\) such that \(PS\) is supported on \(M^{\perp}\).
  More generally, for any \(M\), we have \(g(M)+g(M^{\perp}) = 2k\), where \(g(M)\) is the number of logical-\(X\) and logical-\(Z\) Pauli operators supported fully on \(M\) (up to stabilizers).
  The Cleaning Lemma was originally proven \cite{arxiv:0810.1983}, where an analogous result is states for subsystem codes; see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:2204.04699}.
  \end{defterm}

  Entropic conditions have been formulated for random projective measurement noise \cite{arxiv:2402.00145}.


# A stabilizer code is \textit{geometrically local} if the support of the stabilizer generators is bounded by a ball of size independent of \(n\).

  transversal_gates:
    - 'All stabilizer codes realize Pauli transformations transversally; for a single logical qubit, these a realize dicyclic subgroup of \(SU(2)\).
    Several algorithms exist for finding logical Pauli operators \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9705052,arxiv:0903.5256,arxiv:1803.06987}.'

Such protocols can be made fault tolerant with the help of magic-state distillation \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0403025,arxiv:quant-ph/0410199}. There exist various performance metrics for magic-state distillation \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9806094,arxiv:1807.10296,arxiv:1901.03322,arxiv:1904.01124}. Gate errors in magic-state distillation protocols can sometimes add up destructively \cite{arxiv:1612.01011}. The Hadamard gate cannot be obtained from a magic state \cite{arxiv:2312.03515}. A magic state arising from a generalized controlled \(Z\) gate is a type of hypergraph state \cite{arxiv:1211.5554,arxiv:1404.6492,arxiv:1410.3904} (see \cite{arxiv:2310.16982,arxiv:2404.19005}).'

  decoders:
    - 'The structure of stabilizer codes allows for \textit{syndrome-based decoding}, where errors are corrected based on the results of stabilizer measurements (\textit{syndromes}). The size of the circuit extracting the syndrome depends on the weight of its corresponding stabilizer generator.

If the noise model is such that the most likely error is the lowest-weight error, then ML decoding is called \textit{minimum-weight} decoding. Maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding (a.k.a.\ degenerate maximum-likelihood decoding), i.e., the process of finding the most likely error class (up to degeneracy of errors), is \(\#P\)-complete in general \cite{arxiv:1310.3235}.'
