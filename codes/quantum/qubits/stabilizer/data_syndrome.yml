code_id: data_syndrome
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Quantum data-syndrome (DS) code'
short_name: 'DS code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1409.2559,arxiv:1907.01393}'

description: |
  Stabilizer code designed to correct both data qubit errors and syndrome measurement errors simultaneously due to extra redundancy in their stabilizer generators.

  Extra redundancy can be added to any \([[n,n-m]]\) qubit stabilizer code by expanding its stabilizer generator matrix \(H\) as
  \begin{align}
    H_{DS}=\begin{pmatrix}H & I_{m} & 0\\
    0 & A^{T} & I_{r}
    \end{pmatrix}~,
  \end{align}
  where the redundancy is provided by the underlying \([m+r,m]\) \textit{syndrome measurement code} with generator matrix \(G= (I_m|A)\).

protection: |
  Protects against both physical qubit and syndrome measurement errors.
  Singleton bounds, Hamming bounds, and \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{quantum MacWilliams identities} can be extended to DS codes.

features:
  decoders:
    - 'Syndrome errors are decoded using redundant stabilizer measurements.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Shor error correction \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9605011,arxiv:quant-ph/9605031}, in which fault tolerance against syndrome extraction errors is ensured by simply repeating syndrome measurements \(\ell\) times, can be recast as a DS code whose underlying matrix \(A\) is the identity matrix \(I_m\) repeated \(\ell\) times \cite{arxiv:1907.01393}.'
