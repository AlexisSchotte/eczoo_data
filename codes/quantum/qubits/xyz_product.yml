code_id: xyz_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: XYZ product code

introduced: \cite{arxiv:2011.09746}

description: >
  A non-CSS quantum LDPC code constructed from three classical codes.
  The construction of an XYZ product code is similar to that of a hypergraph product code and related codes.
  The idea is that rather than taking a product of only two classical codes to produce a CSS code, a third classical code is considered, acting with Pauli-Y operators.

features:

  rate: >
    Not much has been proven about the relationship between XYZ product codes and other codes.
    The logical dimension depends on properties of the input classical codes, specifically "similarity invariants" from abstract algebra.
    It is conjectured that specific instances of XYZ product codes have a constant encoding rate and a minimum distance of $d \in \Theta(n^{2/3})$ \cite{arxiv:2011.09746}.

relations:
  parents:
    - code_id: stabilizer
    - code_id: quantum_ldpc
      detail: Using the assumption that the input classical codes are LDPC codes, XYZ product codes will be quantum LDPC codes.

  cousins:
    - code_id: hypergraph_product
      detail: Construction of a balanced product code is similar to a hypergraph product, but using a third classical code.
