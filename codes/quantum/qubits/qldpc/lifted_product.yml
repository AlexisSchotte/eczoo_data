code_id: lifted_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: Lifted-product code

introduced: \cite{arxiv:1904.02703}

description: >
  A QLDPC code that is the "lifted version" of a hypergraph product code.
  The construction of a lifted product code is similar to that of a hypergraph product code; a sort of ''product'' is taken between two input classical codes to produce a CSS code.
  What differentiates a lifted product code from a hypergraph product code is that a reduction of symmetry is exploited to decrease the number of physical qubits required.
  Lifted product codes are notable because they were the first QLDPC codes to achieve almost linear distance.

protection: 'Code performance strongly depends on \(G\) \cite{arxiv:2012.04068}, but lifted product codes contain \cite{arXiv:2111.03654} families of QLDPC codes with the parameters \([[n, k = \Theta(n), d = \Theta(n)]]\).'

features:
  rate: 'Lifted-product codes include the first examples \cite{arXiv:2111.03654} of (asymptotically) \textit{good QLDPC codes}, i.e., codes with asymptotically constant rate and linear distance. The existence of such codes proves the QLDPC conjecture \cite{arXiv:2103.06309}. Another notable family encodes \(k \in \Theta(n^\alpha \log n)\) logical qubits with distance \(d \in \Omega(n^{1 - \alpha} / \log n)\) for any number of physical qubits \(n\) and any real parameter \(0 \leq \alpha < 1\) \cite{arxiv:2012.04068}. There is no known simple way to compute the logical dimension \(k\) in the general case \cite{arxiv:2012.04068}.'

  decoders:
    - BP-OSD decoder \cite{arxiv:1904.02703} adds OSD-like post-processing to the belief propogation decoder for improved performance.

notes:
  - Formerly known as \textit{generalized hypergraph product codes} \cite{arXiv:1904.02703}, and later renamed to lifted-product codes \cite{arXiv:2012.04068,doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040101}.
