       'The Freedman-Meyer-luo code takes a closed Riemann Manifold \(M\) and construct a CSS code. The code is constructed via triangulation of the manifold.'
       'It is shown in the paper that codes derived from higher-dimensional manifolds offer - through the phenomenon of systolic freedom - some improvement larger than constant to the'
       '\(t=\Theta(\sqrt{n})\) bound. Namely, we have the better distance as shown below. This is obtained by studying a weak family of Riemann metrics on closed'
       '4-dimensional manifolds \(S^2\otimes S^2\) with the \(Z_2-homology\).'
