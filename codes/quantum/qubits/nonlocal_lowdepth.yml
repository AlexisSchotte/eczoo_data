description: 'An encoder for an \([n,k]\) quantum error correcting code, is an \(n\)-qubit unitary transformation that takes a \(k\)-qubit state as input (with \(k\leq n\), and the remaining \(n-k\) qubits initialized to \(|0\rangle^{\otimes n-k}\) ) to give a corresponding state in the codespace as the output.An n-qubit quantum circuit with random 2-qubit unitary gates can act as an encoder into a code with distance \(d\) with high probability, given the size (i.e. number of gates in the circuit) is \(O(n^2 logn)\)). Noting that two gates acting on disjoint qubits could in fact be executed simultaneously, this is equivalent to the depth (number of time steps in the circuit) being \(O(log^3n)\).'


protection: 'Creates a \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code that detects errors on \(d-1\) qubits, and corrects errors on \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) qubits.'
