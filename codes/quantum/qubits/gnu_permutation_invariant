physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'GNU Permutation Invariant Codes'

introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1302.3247}'

description: 'GNU permutation invariant codes can be expressed in terms of Dicke states where the logical states are \(\ket{\pm_L} = \sum_{\ell=0}^{n} \frac{\pm 1^\ell}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sqrt{n \choose \ell} \ket{D^m_{g \ell}}. Here \(m\) is the number of particles used for encoding \(1\) qubit and where \(g, n \leq m\) are arbitrary positive integers. \ket{D^m_w} is a Dicke state, which is a normalized permutation invariant state on \(m\) qubits with \(w\) excitations. That is, a normalized sum over all basis elements with \(w\) \(1\)s and \(m - w\) \(0\)s. The logical basis elements can be given by the previous; for example, \(\ket{0_L} = \frac{\ket{+_L} + \ket{-_L}}{2}\)'

protection: 'Depends on the family. One family which is completely symmetrized versions of Bacon-Shor codes (parameterized by \(t\)) protects against arbitrary weight \(t\) qubit errors. Additionally, codes with large enough length \((t+1)(3t+1)+t\) can approximately correct \(t\) spontaneous decay errors.' 

realizations:
  - 'GNU permutation invariant codes lie within the ground state of ferromagnetic Heisenberg models without an external magnetic field. This means such codes may be good for realizing quantum memory. \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.103.144417}'

notes:
  - 'GNU permutation invariant codes can be described using spin-coherent states \cite{arXiv:1708.05010}'

      detail: 'The binomial codes defined in \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevX.6.031006} that can correct photon losses, photon gains, and dephasing events have similar structure to the GNU permutation invariant codes in the case of qubits.'
