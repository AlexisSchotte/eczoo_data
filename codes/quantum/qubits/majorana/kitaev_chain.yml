description: |
  An \([[n,1,1]]_{f}\) Majorana stabilizer code forming the ground-state of the Kitaev Majorana chain (a.k.a. Kitaev Majorana wire) in its fermionic topological phase, which is unitarily equivalent to the 1D quantum Ising model in the symmetry-breaking phase via the Jordan-Wigner transformation.
  The code is usually defined using the algebra of two anti-commuting Majorana operators called \textit{Majorana zero modes (MZMs)} or \textit{Majorana edge modes (MEMs)}.
  It can be thought of as the Majorana stabilizer analogue of the quantum repetition code, and it encodes a logical fermion because its logical Majorana operator has odd weight \cite{arxiv:2411.08955}.

  Codewords have different values of the fermionic parity.
  As a result, this code is considered unphysical because, in the fermionic context, fermion parity conservation prevents one from realizing coherent superpositions between them.
  However, controlling the MZMs associated with this code is an important step to realizing its parent the tetron code, whose codewords have the same parity.

protection: |
  In the fermionic context, code states are insensitive to any local Majorana operator product that respects fermion parity symmetry.
  However, the distance is one because the code does not protect against single Majorana operators, which do not commute with the parity symmetry.
  Disorder may help with protection \cite{arxiv:1108.3845}.
