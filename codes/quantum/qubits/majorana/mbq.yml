name: 'Majorana box qubit'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:cond-mat/0010440,arxiv:1609.01697,arxiv:1610.05289}'

description: |
  An \([[n,1,2]]_{f}\) Majorana stabilizer code forming the even-fermion-parity ground-state subspace of two parallel Kitaev Majorana chains in their fermionic topological phase.
  The \([[2,1,2]]_{f}\) version is called the \textit{tetron Majorana code}.
  An \([[3,2,2]]_{f}\) extension using three Kitaev chains and housing two logical qubits of the same parity is called the \textit{hexon Majorana code}.
  Similarly, \textit{octon}, \textit{decon}, and \textit{dodecon} are codes defined by the positive-parity subspace of \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\) fermionic modes, respectively \cite{arxiv:1801.08143}.


protection: |
  Errors affecting a sufficiently low but even number of Majoranas can be detected and corrected.
  Tetrons can also correct some odd-weight errors \cite{arxiv:2311.01779}.

      detail: 'When treated as ground states of the code Hamiltonian, surface codewords realize, codewords of a single Kitaev chain realize \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) fermionic topological order.
      The MZMs used to define the tetron code act as Ising anyons, which are non-Abelian.'
