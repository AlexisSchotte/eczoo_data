description: 'The H code is a \[k+4,k,2\] CSS quantum codes. It supports transversal Hadmard gates and therefore a good code for magic state distillation. The H code is defined by four stablizer generators \(S_1=X_1X_2X_3X_4\), \(S_2=Z_1Z_2Z_3Z_4\), \(S_3=X_1X_2X_5X_6...X_n\), \(S_4=Z_1Z_2Z_5Z_6...Z_n\)'

protection: 'Detects weight-1 Pauli errors. The r-level contatenated H code detects weight-\(2^r-1\) Pauli errors.

magic: 'The protocals involve multirounds of multilevel concatenantion of H codes. If each round uses one higher level of contatenation than the previous one and in a total of r rounds, the magic-state distillation scaling exponent \(\gamma\), such that the number of input states is \(O(\log^{\gamma}(\epsilon_{in}/\epsilon_{out})\), tends to 1 in the limit of \(k\rightarrow \infty\) and \(r\rightarrow \infty\). This scaling exponent reaches the conjectured bound for \(gamma\)\cite{arXiv:1209.2426}.'

features:

  rate: 'The H codes are dense. The rate \((n-4)/n\rightarrow 1\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\). The distance of the code is 2. However a \(r\)-level concatenation of H codes gives a distance of \(2^r\)'
