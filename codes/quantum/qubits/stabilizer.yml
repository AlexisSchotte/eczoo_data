code_id: stabilizer
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9605005,arXiv:quant-ph/9705052}'

description: |
  An \(((n,2^k,d))\) stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k]]\) or \([[n,k,d]]\), where \(d\) is the code's distance. Logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(2^{n-k}\) commuting Pauli operators forming the code's stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\), which cannot contain \(-I\). The distance is the minimum weight of a Pauli string that implements a nontrivial logical operation on the code.

  Each code can be represented by a \((n-k) \times 2n\) stabilizer generator matrix \(H=(H_X|H_Z)\), where each row \((h_X|h_Z)\) is the binary symplectic representation of a stabilizer generator. (Standard form goes here.)

  Stabilizer codes can be extended to modular-qudit stabilizer codes by decorating appropriate generators with powers. For example, \([[4,2,2]]\) qubit code stabilizer generators can be adjusted to \(ZZZ^{-1} Z^{-1}\) and \(XX^{-1} X^{-1} X\). A systematic procedure extending a qubit code to prime-qudit codes involves putting its generator matrix into \textit{local-translational-invariant (LDI)} form  \cite{arxiv:1910.08122}. Various bounds exist on the distance of the resulting codes \cite{arxiv:2110.11510,arxiv:2110.15274}.

protection: 'Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits. More generally, define the normalizer \(\mathsf{N(S)}\) of \(\mathsf{S}\) to be the set of all operators that commute with all \(S\in\mathsf{S}\). A stabilizer code can correct a Pauli error set \({\mathcal{E}}\) if and only if \(E^\dagger F \notin \mathsf{N(S)}\setminus \mathsf{S}\) for all \(E,F \in {\mathcal{E}}\).'

    - 'Dissipative preparation, for which codespace is steady-state space of a Lindbladian \cite{arXiv:1310.1036}.'
  decoders:
    - 'Errors are corrected based on the results of stabilizer measurements. For few-qubit codes, all stabilizer measurements can be placed in a lookup table. For infinite code families, the size of such a table scales exponentially with \(n\), so algorithms determing the most likely error given a syndrome have to be used.'

Conversely, qubit stabilizer codes can be extended to qudits by decorating the appropriate Pauli strings with powers, and the local-translational-invariant (LDI) form \cite{arxiv:1910.08122} of the generator matrix yields systematic extensions to prime qudits.'
