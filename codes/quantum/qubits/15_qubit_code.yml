code_id: 15_qubit_code
physical: qubits
logical: qubits
name: '[[15,1,3]] code'

description: '
[[15,1,3]] is a tetrahedral 3D color code.
The code contains 15 qubits, represented by four vertices, four face centers, six edge centers, and one body center.
The tetrahedron is cellulated into four identical polyhedron cells by connecting the body center to all four face centers, where each face center is then connected by three adjacent edge centers.
Each colored cell corresponds to a weight-8 \(X\)-check, and each face corresponds to a weight-4 \(Z\)-check.
A logical \(Z\) is any weight-3 \(Z\)-string along an edge of the entire tetrahedron.
The logical \(X\) is any weight-7 \(X\)-face of the entire tetrahedron.
A logical \(T^\dagger\) is implemented by applying a \(T\) gate on every qubit \cite{arXiv:1612.07330}\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9610011}\cite{arXiv:1403.2734}.'

features:
  transversal_gates: 'The code permits transversal \(T\) gates \cite{arXiv:1403.2734}.
                      As a result, it is often used in magic state distillation \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0403025}.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Combining Steane''s code and 15-qubit Reed-Muller code through a fault-tolerant conversion can result in a universal transversal gate set that does not need magic state distillation\cite{arXiv:1403.2734}.'

  rate: 'Magic-state distillation scaling exponent \( \gamma= \log_d (n/k)\approx 2.46\) \cite{arXiv:1703.07847}.'

notes:
  - 'The [[15,1,3]] code is often noted as the 15-qubit quantum Reed-Muller code in the literatue.'
  - 'The [[15,1,3]] code can be converted into the smallest known stabilizer code with a fault-tolerant logical \(T\) gate (i.e., the [[10,1,2]] code) through a process called "morphing procedure" \cite{arXiv:2112.01446}.'
