description: |
  Also known as the \textit{Iceberg} code. CSS stabilizer code for \(m\geq 2\) with generators \(\{XX\cdots X, ZZ\cdots Z\} \) acting on all \(2m\) physical qubits.
  Admits a basis such that each codeword is a superposition of a computational basis state labeled by a bitstring \(b\) and a state labeled by the negation of \(b\).
  Such states generalize the two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit GHz states and are often called cat states.

protection: 'Detects a single-qubit error.'
