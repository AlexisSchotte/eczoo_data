name: '\([[2m,2m-2,2]]\) error-detecting code'
short_name: '\([[2m,2m-2,2]]\)'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9605021,arxiv:quant-ph/9702029}'

description: |
  Also known as the \textit{iceberg} code. CSS stabilizer code for \(m\geq 2\) with generators \(\{XX\cdots X, ZZ\cdots Z\} \) acting on all \(2m\) physical qubits.
  Admits a basis such that each codeword is a superposition of a computational basis state labeled by a bitstring \(b\) and a state labeled by the negation of \(b\).
  Such states generalize the two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit GHz states and are often called cat states.
