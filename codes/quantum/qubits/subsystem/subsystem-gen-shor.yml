name: 'Subsystem-Generalized Shor Code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0610088v2}'


description: |
  For every generalized Shor code, there is a subsystem code which has the same parameters as the subspace version, but requires significantly fewer stabilizer measurements, resulting in a much simpler error recovery routine.

  This code is constructed from two classical linear codes, \(\mathcal{C}_1 = [n_1, k_1, d_1]$ and $\mathcal{C}_2 = [n_2, k_2, d_2]\). It has considerable advantages over the subspace code when it comes to the complexity of error recovery routine, providing a quadratic savings in the number of stabilizers which need to be measured.

protection: 'Detecting single qubit errors of weight \(min(d_1,d_2)\), this code corrects bit flip and phase flip errors modulo the subsystem structure.'

features:

  encoders:
    - 'Let \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) be the generator matrices for \(\mathcal{C}_1\) and \(\mathcal{C}_2\) respectively, \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) be the parity check matrices for \(\mathcal{C}_1\) and \(\mathcal{C}_2\) respectively.'
    - 'Construct stabilizer codes on \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) qubits respectively, using the rows of \(P_1\) and \(P_2\): \(\mathcal{S}_1\) is the stabilizer generated by \(\{S_i: S_i = \otimes_{j=1}^{n_1}Z^{(P_1)_{ij}}, 1 \leq i \leq n_1 - k_1\}\), and \(\mathcal{S}_2\) is the stabilizer generated by \(\{T_i: T_i = \otimes_{j=1}^{n_2}X^{(P_2)_{ij}}, 1 \leq i \leq n_2 - k_2\}\). Correspondingly, the first code corrects $\lfloor\frac{d_1-1}{2}\rfloor$ bit flip errors and the second code corrects \(\lfloor\frac{d_2-1}{2}\rfloor\) phase flip errors.'
    - 'Let \(n = n_1 + n_2\). Consider a square lattice of size \(n \times n\) with qubits located at the vertices of this lattice. Let \(\mathcal{O}_{ij}\) denote the operator \(\mathcal{O}\) acting on the qubit located on the \(i\)th row and \(j\)th column of this lattice tensored with identity on all other qubits. Let \(\mathcal{T}_1\) be the stabilizer group made up of letting \(\mathcal{S}_1\) operators acting on all of the columns of the lattice. Let \(\mathcal{T}_2\) be the stabilizer group made up of letting \(\mathcal{S}_2$\) operators acting on all of the rows of the lattice.'
    - '\(\mathcal{T} = \langle \mathcal{T}_1, \mathcal{T}_2\rangle\) consists of Pauli operators which have an even number of \(X_{i,j}\) operators in each column, and an even number of \(Z_{i,j}\) operators in each row. \(\mathcal{T}\) is nonabelian. Let \(\mathcal{S}\) be an abelian subgroup of \(\mathcal{T}\). It consists of Pauli operators which are made up of an even number of rows consisting entirely of \(X\) operators and an even number of columns consisting entirely of \(Z\) operators. Let \(\mathcal{L}\) be the set of logical operators who commute with elements of \(\mathcal{T}\) and \(\mathcal{S}\).'
    - 'To form a subsystem code using \(\mathcal{T}\), \(\mathcal{S}\), and \(\mathcal{L}\), note that there are $(n_1-k_1)k_2$ stabilizer generators made up of tensor product of $I$ and $Z$ operators and $(n_2-k_2)k_1$ stabilizer generators made up of tensor product of $I$ and $X$ operators. In total, there are $(n_1-k_1)k_2+(n_2-k_2)k_1$ stabilizer generators. Then proceed following \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0506023v4}.'

  decoders:
    - 'By measuring the generators of \(\mathcal{S}\), we can correct errors related to the classical linear codes \(\mathcal{C}_1\) and \(\mathcal{C}_2\).'

notes:
  - 'In a generalized \([[n1n2, k1k2, min(d1, d2)]]\) Shor code, the error correction is achieved by measuring (n1−k1)n2+(n2−k2) stabilizer generators \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0508131}. This subsystem generalized Shor code has achieved the same parameters for the code but using only \((n1−k1)k2+k1(n2−k2)\) stabilizer measurements.'
