description: |
  For every generalized Shor code, there is a subsystem code which has the same parameters as the subspace version, but requires significantly fewer stabilizer measurements, resulting in a much simpler error recovery routine.

  Following the construction outlined in \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0506023}, this QECC is constructed from two classical linear codes, \(\mathcal{C}_1 = [n_1, k_1, d_1]\) and \(\mathcal{C}_2 = [n_2, k_2, d_2]\): \([[n_1n_2,k_1k_2,min(d_1,d_2)]]\). It has considerable advantages over the subspace code when it comes to the complexity of error recovery routine, providing a quadratic savings in the number of stabilizers which need to be measured.

  The code is constructed as follows, and the subsystem being defined accordingly:

  Let \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) be the generator matrices for \(\mathcal{C}_1\) and \(\mathcal{C}_2\) respectively, \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) be the parity check matrices for \(\mathcal{C}_1\) and \(\mathcal{C}_2\) respectively. Using the rows of \(H_1\) and \(H_2\), construct stabilizers on \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) qubits respectively, so that the stabilizer code of \(\mathcal{S}_1\) corrects \(\lfloor\frac{d_1-1}{2}\rfloor\) bit-flip errors, and that of \(\mathcal{S}_2\) corrects \(\lfloor\frac{d_2-1}{2}\rfloor\) phase-flip errors. 

  \begin{align*}
  S_i &= \otimes_{j=1}^{n_1}Z^{(H_1)_{ij}} & T_i &= \otimes_{j=1}^{n_2}X^{(H_2)_{ij}} \\
  \mathcal{S}_1 &=\langle S_1,\ldots,S_{n_1-k_1}\rangle & \mathcal{S}_2 &= \langle T_1,\ldots,T_{n_2-k_2} \rangle
  \end{align*}
  
  Let \(n = n_1 + n_2\). Consider a square lattice of size \(n \times n\) with a qubit located at each vertex. Let \(\mathcal{T}_1\) be the stabilizer group made up of letting \(\mathcal{S}_1\) operators acting on all columns of the lattice. Let \(\mathcal{T}_2\) be the stabilizer group made up of letting \(\mathcal{S}_2\) operators acting on all rows of the lattice. Then \(\mathcal{T} = \langle\mathcal{T}_1,\mathcal{T}_2\rangle\). \(\mathcal{T}\) is non-abelian and from which we can construct an abelian invariant subgroup \(\mathcal{S}\) of \(\mathcal{T}\). \(\mathcal{S}\) is the group generated by \(\mathcal{S}_1\) and \(\mathcal{S}_2\) for all stabilizer codeword combinations in both rows and columns. By construction, \(\mathcal{S}\) is a stabilizer with \((n_1 - k_1)k_2\) stabilizer generators (i.e., the tensor product of \(I\) and \(Z\) operators), and  \((n_2 - k_2)k_1\) stabilizer generators (i.e., the tensor product of \(I\) and \(X\) operators). Next, we can construct a group of logical Paulis on \(k_1k_2\) qubits using the logical operators of \(\mathcal{S}_1\) and \(\mathcal{S}_2\).

  Based on the above construction, the Hilbert space on \(n_1n_2\) qubits can be decomposed into a multiple direct sums of multiple tensor products of Hilbert spaces of lower dimensions, as outlined in \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0506023}. Then the error recovery procedure could correct information encoded into the subsystem.
