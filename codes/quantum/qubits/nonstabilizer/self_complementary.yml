physical: qubits
logical: qubits


name: 'Self-complementary quantum code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0701065,arxiv:0712.2586}'

description: |
  A qubit code which admits a basis of codewords of the form \(|c\rangle+|\overline{c}\rangle\), where \(c\) is a bitstring and \(\overline{c}\) is its negation a.k.a. complement. 
  Their codewords generalize the two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit GHz states and are often called \textit{(qubit) cat states} or \textit{poor-man's GHz states}.
  Such codes were originally pointed out to perform well against \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} noise \cite{arxiv:0712.2586}.


protection: |
  Self-complementary codes automatically protect against a single \(Z\) error \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0701065}. Codes consisting of computational basis states whose bitstrings are sufficiently spaced apart correct at least one \hyperref[topic:ad]{AD} error \cite[Thm. 2.5]{arxiv:0712.2586}\cite[Thm. 2]{arxiv:0907.5149}.

      detail: 'A linear binary code is called \textit{self-complementary} if, for each codeword \(c\), its negation \(\overline{c}\) is also a codeword.'
