description: |
  A quantum error-correcting code that protects the encoded interior of a black hole from computationally bounded exterior observers.
  Under the assumption that the Hawking radiation emitted by an old black hole is pseudorandom, there exists a subspace of the radiation system that encodes the black hole interior, entangled with the late outgoing Hawking quanta.
  The logical operators of this code commute with efficient operations acting on the radiation, protecting the interior up to corrections exponentially small in the black hole's entropy.

  This code has been tested in various models of gravity \cite{arxiv:2003.05451,arxiv:2203.01961}.

protection: |
  Protection relies on the pseudorandomness of the radiation and the computational hardness of distinguishing the encoded state from a maximally mixed state.
