name: 'H code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.87.042305}'

description: 'The H code is a \[k+4,k,2\] CSS quantum codes. It supports transversal Hadmard gates and therefore a good code for magic state distillation. The H code \([[n, k = n-4, 2]]\) is defined by four stablizer generators \(S_1=X_1X_2X_3X_4\), \(S_2=Z_1Z_2Z_3Z_4\), \(S_3=X_1X_2X_5X_6...X_n\), \(S_4=Z_1Z_2Z_5Z_6...Z_n\).'

protection: 'Detects weight-1 Pauli errors. The r-level contatenated H code detects weight-\(2^r-1\) Pauli errors.'

features:
  magic_scaling_exponent: 'The protocals involve multirounds of multilevel concatenantion of H codes. If each round uses one higher level of contatenation than the previous one and in a total of r rounds, the magic-state distillation scaling exponent \(\gamma\), such that the number of input states is \(O(\log^{\gamma}(\epsilon_{in}/\epsilon_{out})\), tends to 1 in the limit of \(k\rightarrow \infty\) and \(r\rightarrow \infty\). This scaling exponent reaches the conjectured bound for \(gamma\)\cite{arXiv:1209.2426}.'

  rate: 'The H codes are dense. The rate \((n-4)/n\rightarrow 1\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\). The distance of the code is 2. However a \(r\)-level concatenation of H codes gives a distance of \(2^r\)'

  encoders:
    - 'Encoder for magic states for the code constructed in \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.87.042305}'
   
  transversal_gates: 'Admits transversal Hadmard gates and the transversal \(TXT\dagger) gate (Clifford equivalent to Hadmard gate), where \(T=exp(i\pi(I-\sigma^z)/8)\) is the \(\pi/8\) rotation gate'
  
  general_gates:
    - 'The H codes can be used for high-quality and high-efficiency magic-state distillation \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.87.042305}.'

notes:
   - 'The multi-level magic states protocals supported by H code have a efficency advantage over the 10-to-2 and 15-to-1 protocals for output error \(\epsilon_{out}\)below \(10^{-7}\).'
