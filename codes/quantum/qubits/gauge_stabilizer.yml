description: |
  Also called a \textit{subssytem stabilizer code}. A stabilizer code with some of its logical qubits denoted as \textit{gauge} qubits and not used for storage of logical information. Subsystem codes are denoted by \([[n,k,r,d]]\), similar to stabilizer codes, but with an extra parameter \(r\) denoting the number of gauge qubits.

  Choose \(2n\) operators \{ X_j',Z_j'\}_{j=1}^n' from \(\mathsf{P}_n\), the Pauli group on \(n\) qubits, such that they obey the same commutation relations as the regular \(n\)-qubit Pauli generators \( \{X_j,Z_j\}_{j=1}^n \) (the subscript on these latter operators indicates the single qubit the Pauli matrix acts on). The primed operators might act on more than one physical (or \textit{bare}) qubit but they behave as if they acted only on a single qubit. WLOG we can choose a stabilizer group as \( \mathsf{S} = \langle Z_1,\dots,Z_s \rangle \). It follows that the normalizer of \(\mathsf{S} \) is \( N(\mathsf{S}) = \langle i,Z_1',\dots,Z_n',X_{s+1}',\dots,X_n' \rangle \). We now choose a gauge group as \( \mathsf{G} = \langle i, Z_1',\dots,Z_s', X_{s+1}',Z_{s+1}', \dots, X_{s+r}',Z_{s+r}' \rangle \) with \( s + r \leq n \). The logical group is choosen as \( \mathsf{L} = N(\mathsf{S})/\mathsf{G} \simeq \langle X_{s+r+1}',Z_{s+r+1}', \dots, X_n',Z_n' \rangle \). The codespace \( C \) is as usual the \(+1\) eigenspace of the stabilizer \( \mathsf{S} \). But the gauge and logical groups have further decomposed this space into \( C = A \otimes B \simeq (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes k} \otimes (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes r} \). Thus, the Hilbert space is partitioned into 3 sets; \(k\) logical qubits, \(r\) gauge qubits, and \(s\) stabilizer qubits, with \(s+r+k=n\).

protection: 'Detects errors on \(d-1\) qubits, corrects errors on \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) qubits. More generally, a set of errors \( \{ E_a \} \) is correctable iff \( E_aE_b \not\in N(\mathsf{S}) \setminus \mathsf{G} \) for all pairs \(a,b\). The distance of the code is the minimal weight of operators in \( N(\mathsf{S}) \setminus \mathsf{G}\).'

notes:
    - 'When the gauge group \( \mathsf{G} \) is abelian, the above is reduced to the standard stabilizer formalism.'
