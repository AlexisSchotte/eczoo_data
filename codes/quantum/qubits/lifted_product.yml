code_id: lifted_product
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: Lifted Product Code

introduced: \cite{arxiv:1904.02703}

description: >
  A quantum LDPC code that is the "lifted version" of a hypergraph product code, formerly known as "generalized hypergraph product codes" \cite{arxiv:1904.02703}, and later renamed to "lifted product codes" \cite{arxiv:2012.04068,doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040101}.
  The construction of a lifted product code is similar to that of a hypergraph product code and related codes; a sort of "product" is taken between two input classical codes to produce a CSS code.
  What differentiates a lifted product code from a hypergraph product code is that a reduction of symmetry is exploited to decrease the number of physical qubits required.
  Lifted product codes are notable because they were the first quantum LDPC codes to achieve almost linear distance.

features:

  rate: >
    There is no known simple way to compute the logical dimension $k$ in the general case \cite{arxiv:2012.04068}.
    However, there is a notable family of lifted product codes with logical dimension $k \in \Theta(n^\alpha \log n)$ and distance $d \in \Omega(n^{1 - \alpha} / \log n)$ for any number of physical qubits $n$ and any real parameter $0 \leq \alpha < 1$ \cite{arxiv:2012.04068}.
    The rate is then $\frac k n \in \Theta(n^{\alpha - 1} \log n)$.

  decoders:
    - BP-OSD decoder \cite{arxiv:1904.02703} adds OSD-like post-processing to the belief propogation decoder for improved performance.

relations:
  parents:
    - code_id: css
      detail: A pairwise commutativity assumption in the input classical codes ensures that the result is a CSS code.
    - code_id: quantum_ldpc
      detail: Assuming the input classical codes are LDPC codes, the lifted product is a quantum LDPC code.

  cousins:
    - code_id: hypergraph_product
      detail: Construction of a lifted product code is very similar to a hypergraph product, but with a reduction of symmetry.
    - code_id: balanced_product
      detail: Both are based on a reduction of symmetry in the hypergraph product.
    - code_id: homological_product
