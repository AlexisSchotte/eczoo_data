code_id: hamiltonian

name: 'Hamiltonian-based code'
#introduced: ''

description: 'Encoding consists of a set of energy eigenstates of a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian. The codespace is typically a set of low-energy eigenstates or ground states, but can include subspaces of arbitrarily high energy. When the physical space is a tensor product of subsystems, the Hamiltonian is typically \textit{local}, consisting of operators acting on a number of subsystems that is independent of the total number of subsystems (e.g., quantum_ldpc). When the physical space is endowed with a geometry, the Hamiltonian is typically \textit{geometrically local}, consisting of operators acting on subsystems that occupy a region whose size is independent of the number of subsystems (e.g., topological codes).'

protection: 'Often determined from the underlying physical properties of the Hamiltonian.'
