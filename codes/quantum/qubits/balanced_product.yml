logical: qubits

name: Balanced product code

introduced: \cite{arxiv:2012.09271}

description: >
  Construction of a balanced-product code is similar to that of a hypergraph product code and related codes, namely, a sort of "product" is taken between two input classical codes to produce a CSS code.
  What differentiates a balanced product code from a hypergraph product code is that (like with lifted product codes) a reduction of symmetry is exploited to decrease the number of physical qubits required.
  Balanced product codes are notable because a family of them can be explicitly and nonrandomly constructed to have distance \(d \in \Omega(n^{3/5})\).

features:

  rate: >
    A notable family of balanced product codes encode \(k \in \Theta(n^{4/5})\) logical qubits with distance \(d \in \Omega(n^{3/5})\) for any number of physical qubits \(n\).
    Additionally, it is known that the code constructed from the balanced product of two good classical LDPC codes over groups of order \(\Theta(n)\) has a constant encoding rate \cite{2012.09271}.
