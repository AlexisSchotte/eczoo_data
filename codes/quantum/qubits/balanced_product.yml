logical: qubits

name: Balanced product code

introduced: \cite{arxiv:2012.09271}

description: >
  A nonrandom quantum LDPC code with relatively good distance.
  The construction of a balanced product code is similar to that of a hypergraph product code and related codes; a sort of "product" is taken between two input classical codes to produce a CSS code.
  What differentiates a balanced product code from a hypergraph product code is that (like with lifted product codes) a reduction of symmetry is exploited to decrease the number of physical qubits required.
  Balanced product codes are notable because a family of them can be explicitly and nonrandomly constructed to have distance $d \in \Omega(n^{3/5})$.

features:

  rate: >
    A notable family of balanced product codes encode $k \in \Theta(n^{4/5})$ logical qubits with distance $d \in \Omega(n^{3/5})$ for any number of physical qubits $n$.
    Additionally, it is known that the code constructed from the balanced product of two good classical LDPC codes over groups of order $\Theta(n)$ has a constant encoding rate \cite{2012.09271}.
