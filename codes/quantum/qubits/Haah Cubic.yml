logical: qubits

name: 'Haah cubic code'

introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1101.1962}'

description: 'Haah Cubic codes are a class of stabilizer codes on an infinite cubic lattice \(\mathbb{Z}^3\) with one or two qubits per site. We also require that the stabilizer group \(\mathsf{S}\) is translation invariant and generated by two types of operators with support on a cube. In the non-CSS case these two are related by spatial inversion. For CSS codes we require that the product of all corner operators is the identity. We lastly require that there are no non-trival ''string operators'', meaning that single site operators are a phase, and any period one (\(l_{\infty}\) metric) \(l \in \mathsf{S}^{\perp}\) is just a phase. Haah showed in his original construction that there is exactly one non-CSS code of this form, and 17 CSS codes \cite{arXiv:1101.1962}. The non-css code is labeled code 0, and the rest are numbered from 1 - 17. CSS codes 1-4 do not have string logical operators, while codes 11-17 do. '

protection: 'The Haah Cubic codes protect against simultaneous independent pauli errors on different sites (not qubits, since there can be 2 qubits per site). Out of the 17 codes given, 5 codes are known to have distance \(d \ge L\), meaning they can achieve macroscopic code distance as we scale to larger system volumes.'

features:

  threshold: 
  - 'The encoding rate depends on the code implemented, but Code 0 has been shown to have \(k \ge L\) (on a periodic finite cubic lattice of side length \(L\). In general we expect the number of logical bits to scale as \(k \sim L\).'

realizations:
  - 'Bravyi and Haah did some numerical simulations of cubic stabilizer codes and showed that \(T_{\rm{mem}}(\beta) \ge e^{c \beta^2/12}\), suggesting the possibility of macroscopically feasible memory times \cite{arXiv:1112.3252}'

notes:
  - 'In 3D we have \(k d = O(L^3) \) \cite{arXiv:0909.5200}, meaning that we must have fewer qubits per site \(m\) than types of generator \(t\), since if \(t < m\) then \(d = O(1)\)'
  - 'Codes 0-4 on a periodic \(\mathbb{Z}_L^3\) has distance \(d \ge L\) \cite{arXiv:1101.1962}'
  - 'The energy of any partial implementation of code 1 is proportional to the boundary length similar to the 4D Toric Code, which can potentially surpress the effects of thermal errors, but it is currently an open problem.'
