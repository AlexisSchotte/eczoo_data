code_id: xysurface
name: XY code
description: 'Non-CSS derivative of the surface code whose generators are \(XXXX\)  and
  \(YYYY\) obtained by permuting $Z$''s with $Y$''s in the CSS surface code   '
physical: qubits
logical: qubits
protection: As a stabilizer code, \([[n=O(d^2), k=O(1), d]]\).
features:
  threshold:
  - "Fault-tolerant threshold of 6.32(3)% for infinite $Z$ bias, and thresholds of
    âˆ¼ 5% for $Z$ biases around $\\eta = 100$ using a variant of the minimum-weight
    perfect matching decoder \nhttps://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.130501"
  code_capacity_threshold:
  - "\\(50\\%\\) at infinite \\(Z\\) bias using the maximum-likelihood decoder. \n\n\\(18.7\\%\\)
    at standard depolarising noise with a maximum-likelihood decoder."

    detail: "\\(XY\\) code is a particular CDSC obtained from the surface code by
      applying $H\\sqrt{Z}H$ gates that permute Pauli operators $Y$ and $Z$ while
      XZZX is a particular CDSC obtained from the surface code by applying $H$ gates
      that permute Pauli operators $X$ and $Z$. "
