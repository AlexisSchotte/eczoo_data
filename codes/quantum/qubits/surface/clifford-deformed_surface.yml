code_id: clifford-deformed_surface
physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: Clifford-deformed surface code (CDSC)
#introduced: \cite{}

description: 'Non-CSS derivative of the surface code. CDSCs include codes whose thresholds
  and subthreshold performance are enhanced under noise biased towards dephasing,
  unlike typical CSS codes. Examples of CDSCs include the \(XY\) code, \(XZZX\) code, and random
  CDSCs.'

protection: As a stabilizer code, \([[n=O(d^2), k=O(1), d]]\).

features:
  fault_tolerance:
  - In order to leverage the benefits of CDSCs into practical universal computation,
    we have to implement syndrome measurement circuits and fault-tolerant logical
    gates in a bias-preserving way.
  code_capacity_threshold:
  - 'A class of random CDSCs, parametrized by the probabilities \(P_{XZ},~ P_{YZ}\)
    of \(X\leftrightarrow Z\) and \(Y\leftrightarrow Z\) Pauli permutations, respectively,
    has \(50\%\) code capacity threshold at infinite \(Z\) bias.'
  - 'Particular translation-invariant CDSCs such as the \(XY\) code and the \(XZZX\) code also have 50\\%
    code capacity threshold at infinite $Z$ bias.'
  - '\(XZZX\) code and the \((0.5,\\piyz)\) random CDSCs have a \(50\%\) code capacity threshold for noise infinitely biased towards either Pauli-\(X\), \(Y\), or \(Z\) errors.'
