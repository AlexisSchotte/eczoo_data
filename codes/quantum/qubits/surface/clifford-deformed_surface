name: Clifford-deformed Surface Codes (CDSCs)
description: 'Non-CSS derivatives of the surface code. CDSCs include codes whose thresholds
  and subthreshold performance are enhanced under noise biased towards dephasing,
  unlike the CSS code. Examples of CDSCs include the XY code, XZZX code, and random
  CDSCs. '
physical: qubits
logical: qubits
protection: As a stabilizer code, \([[n=O(d^2), k=O(1), d]]\).
features:
  fault_tolerance:
  - In order to leverage the benefits of \mbox{CDSCs} into practical universal computation,
    we have to implement syndrome measurement circuits and fault-tolerant logical
    gates in a bias-preserving way.
  code_capacity_threshold:
  - "A class of random CDSCs, parametrized by the probabilities $\\Pi_{XZ},\\ \\Pi_{YZ}$
    of $X\\leftrightarrow Z$ and $Y\\leftrightarrow Z$ Pauli permutations, respectively,
    have 50\\% code capacity threshold at infinite $Z$ bias. \n\nCarefully constructed
    translation-invariant CDSCs such as the XY code and the XZZX code also have 50\\%
    code capacity threshold at infinite $Z$ bias. \n\nThe XZZX code and the $(0.5,\\piyz)$
    random \\mbox{CDSC}s have a 50\\% code capacity threshold for noise infinitely
    biased towards either Pauli-$X$, $Y$, or $Z$ errors and not just towards $Z$ errors."
