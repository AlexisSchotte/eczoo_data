description: 'Define a shift operator, \(\mathcal{N}\), such that \(\mathcal{N}\ket{x_1 x_2 \dots x_{n}}=\ket{x_{n} x_1 \dots x_{n-1}}\\). A quantum code \(C\) on \(n\) qubits is a quantum cyclic code if for every codeword \(\ket{\psi}\in C\), the cyclically shifted vector \(\mathcal{N}\ket{\psi}\in C\).'

features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

  # rate: 'Unknown.'

  # This field that starts a list of strings, indexed by a dash; do not leave it
  # empty. If empty, comment out.

# realizations:
#   # List and explain the different "domains" of realizations in list items.
