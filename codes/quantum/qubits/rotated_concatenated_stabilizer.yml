physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Rotated Concatenated Stabilizer Codes'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2010.00538}'

description: |
A \([[2n,k,d]]\) rotated concatenated stabilizer code is a quantum error-correcting code constructed by concacenating an outer \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer code with the inner dual-rail code which encodes \(|\bar{0}\rangle=|01\rangle\) and \(|\bar{1}\rangle=|10\rangle\)\cite{arXiv:2010.00538}.

protection: |
A rotated concatenated stabilizer code is a constant-excitation code, hence immune to coherent phase errors acting identically and simultaneously on all qubits\cite{arXiv:2010.00538}.

The rotated concatenated stabilizer code obtained by choosing the outer stabilizer code to be the 4-qubit code devised in \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9704002} can correct a single amplitude damping error\cite{arXiv:2010.00538}.

features:

  transversal_gates: 'If the outer stabilizer code has a transversal encoded operation realizable by a tensor product of single-qubit Paulis, then the same encoded operation can also be implementedd as a tensor product of single-qubit Paulis in the concatenated code\cite{arXiv:2010.00538}.'

  threshold:
    - 'If the outer stabilizer code is a CSS code with transversal logical single-qubit Paulis given by \(\overline{P}=P^{\otimes n}\) for every \(P\in\{I,X,Y,Z\}\), then the concatenated code has a positive fault-tolerant threshold w.r.t stochastic noise\cite{arXiv:2010.00538}.'
