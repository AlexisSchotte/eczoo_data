  Stub. (see Sec. III E of \cite{arXiv:1805.01474})

protection: |
  The symmetric energy barrier grows linearly with the lattice width. When the system is coupled locally to a thermal bath respecting the symmetry and below a critical temperature, the memory time grows expoenetially with the lattice width.
