physical: qubits
logical: qubits

name: 'Local Haar random circuit code'

introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1007/s00220-016-2706-8}'

description: 'Two states are locally indistinguishable if there exists an orthogonal state which cannot be distinguished from it by local measurements (this is analogous to the notion of topological order from condensed matter physics). In this code, the code states are a pair of approximately locally indistinguishable states produced by starting with any two orthogonal states on \(n\) qubits and acting with a random unitary circuit of depth linear in \(n\). A single layer of the encoding circuit is composed of about \(n/2\) two-qubit nearest-neighbor gates run in parallel. Each individual gate is drawn randomly from the Haar distribution on two-qubit unitaries.'

protection: 'Protects against any error with support on a region of length\(\leq n/4\), where \(n\) is the number of physical qubits.'
