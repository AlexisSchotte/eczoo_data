  Here is a general construction for any finite group \(G\) acting on a finite set 
  \(A\) as a subgroup of the symmetric group on \(|A|\) elements, \(G \subset S_{|A|}\).  
  Let \(\mathcal{E}_0: \mathcal{H}_{\text{logical}} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{\text{physical}} 
  = \mathcal{H}^{\otimes n}\) be any code, possibly non-covariant, capable of perfect 
  recovery after an erasure of $k$ of out $n$ physical subsystems.  Now define the new 
  encoder \(\mathcal{E} \equiv \mathcal{E}_0^{\otimes |A|}: \mathcal{H}_{\text{logical}}^{\otimes |A|} 
  \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{\text{physical}}^{\otimes |A|}\).  The group acts as

  I am very sorry about the incompleteness of this, but I am a little confused at what the 
  construction in section VII. Case 3 of [] is doing.  What exactly is being erased?  
  Is it a subset of the \(|A|\) copies of \(\mathcal{H}_{\text{physical}}\) or of the 
  individual modes within a single copy?  In other words, in Fig. 2, is the final outermost 
  noise channel erasing entire forks, parallel prongs of forks, or an arbitrary subset of 
  all prongs?  Seems to me that it should be entire forks to be in line with the covariant 
  code framework and the definition \(\mathcal{E}=\mathcal{E}_0^{\otimes |A|}\).  But then 
  why have the original non-covariant encoder \(\mathcal{E}_0\) map to a collection of 
  subsystems instead of some arbitrary space, or being able to correct specifically erasure 
  errors?  Why not have an arbitrary encoder capable of correcting an arbitrary choice of 
  error set (not necessarily erasure), then cloning that \(|A|\) times?  

  Some thoughts: the group must act on \(|A|\) things, and the only sets of that size are 
  the index set of \(|A|\) tensor copies of \(\mathcal{H}_{\text{physical}}\) and 
  \(\mathcal{H}_{\text{logical}}\).  Covariance demands that the encoder commutes with 
  this permutation; I don't see where the smaller structure within 
  \(\mathcal{H}_{\text{physical}}\) and \(\mathcal{H}_{\text{logical}}\) come up.  If 
  this is indeed the case, is it a repetition code of some sort in disguise?  i.e. making 
  copies of some working code, allow for their permutation by nature of the tensor product, 
  erase some of the copies, then decode from any one of the remaining copies?

  I'm also confused about this for another less important but possibly related reason.  
  I believe symmetric groups \(S_n\) on \(n\) items have order \(n!\) yet the paper has 
  \(G=A=S_3\) where \(A\) is of size \(3\neq 3! = 6\).  I doubt this affects anything but 
  wanted to mention it just in case.
