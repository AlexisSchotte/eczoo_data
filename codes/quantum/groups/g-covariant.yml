code_id: g_covariant

name: '\(G\)-covariant code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1709.04471}'

description: |
  A general class of codes where the encoding map is equivariant (i.e. commutes) 
  with group actions on the logical and physical spaces.  The physical space is in 
  general comprised of \(n\) distinct subsystems, some possibly being infinite 
  dimensional.  The physical group action is the unitary tensor product
  representation, making physical group actions intrinsically transversal with 
  respect to the \(n\)-subsystem decomposition.

protection: |
  The noise model is an erasure of a known subset of the physical subsystems.  
  The ability to perfectly protect however depends on both the group and the 
  physical space.  A partial classification result is the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A: The group contains a continuous symmetry and the total physical space 
  dimension is finite (i.e. a Lie group into qudits).  In this case, there cannot 
  exist a perfect covariant code that corrects against erasure.
  \item B: finite group + finite physical, or, finite group + infinite physical.  
  In either case, perfect covariant codes exist \cite{arxiv:1709.04471}.
  \end{itemize}
  The above classification result may be thought of as a generalization of the 
  Eastin-Knill theorem \cite{arxiv:0811.4262}.  In particular, set the logical 
  space to be \(N\) qudits, the physical space to be a finite collection of 
  qudits, and \(G=U(N)\).  The existence of covariant codes perfectly correcting 
  against erasure in case B represents the in-principle ability to circumvent 
  the Eastin-Knill theorem.  Approximate codes for case A have been considered 
  in \cite{arxiv:1902.07714}.'
