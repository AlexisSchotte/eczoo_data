logical: qudits

name: '\(G\)-covariant code'
introduced: 'doi: 10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.010326'

description: |
  A general class of codes where the encoding map is equivariant (i.e. commutes) 
  with group actions on the logical and physical spaces.  The physical space is in 
  general comprised of \(n\) distinct subsystems, some possibly being infinite 
  dimensional.  The physical group action is the unitary tensor product
  representation, making physical group actions intrinsically transversal with 
  respect to the \(n\)-subsystem decomposition.

protection: |
  The noise model is an erasure of a known subset of the physical subsystems.  
  The ability to perfectly protect however depends on both the group and the 
  physical space.  A partial classification result is the following: (need to 
  figure out how to make yml bulletin).  A. The group contains a continuous
  symmetry and the total physical space dimension is finite (i.e. a Lie group 
  into qudits).  In this case, there cannot exist a perfect covariant code that 
  corrects against erasure.  B. finite group + finite physical, or, finite 
  group + infinite physical.  In either case, perfect covariant codes exist 
  cite={doi:10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.010326}.  Approximate codes for case A have 
  been considered in cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevX.10.041018}.'

notes:
  - 'Strongly linked to the error correction of quantum reference frames \cite{doi: 10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.010326}.'
  - 'The above classification result may be thought of as a generalization of the Eastin-Knill theorem cite{doi: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.110502}.  In particular, set the logical space to be \(N\) qudits, the physical space to be a finite collection of qudits, and \(G=U(N)\).  The existence of covariant codes perfectly correcting against erasure in case B represents the in-principle ability to circumvent the Eastin-Knill theorem.'
