code_id: very-small-logical-qubit
physical: groups
logical: qubits

name: 'Very small logical qubit (VSLQ) code'

introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.150501}'

description: 'The code states are \(|\pm\rangle \propto (|0\rangle\pm|2\rangle)(|0\rangle\pm|2\rangle)|0\rangle|0\rangle\), where the total Hilbert space is the tensor product of two qudits (whose ground states \(|0\rangle\) and second excited states \(|2\rangle\) are used in the codewords) and two oscillators. In the original proposal for implementation, the single logical qubit is given by the two lowest energy states of a circuit composed of two transmons coupled to two lossy resonators.'

protection: 'Passively protects against single photon loss.'

features:


  #rate:

  encoders: 
    - 'Engineering a circuit made of two transmons and two oscillators coupled through three driven superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) results in passive stabilization of the logical states.'

  #transversal_gates:

  general_gates:
    - 'Single logical qubit operations implemented by resonant physical qubit driving and phase shifting the SQUID drives.'
    - 'A CZ gate between two logical qubits implemented by coupling devices through another driven SQUID and applying a pulse to the coupling squid simultaneously with a single qubit operation on one of the logical qubits.'

  decoders:
    - 'Logical qubit can be measured with physical qubit measurements along \(X\). Can be implemented according to \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.203601}, by engineering a coupling of one of the qubits to a readout cavity via the interaction \(\sigma_x (a+a^\dag)\). This results in an \(X\)-dependent shift of the readout cavity resonance which can be measured.'

  #threshold: 
  
#realizations:
 
notes:
  - 'The lossy resonators can also be lossy qubits.'

      detail: 'Hybrid_qudit oscillator code giving a qubit out of two qubits and two oscillators, i.e. \(K=2,\,n_1=2,\,q=2,\,n_2=2\).'

  cousins:
    - code_id: quantum_repetition
      detail: 'The simplest quantum repetition code that corrects phase flips has logical states \(|\pm\rangle = |\pm\rangle^{\otimes 3}\). The VSLQ code states have similar structure, though they cannot correct phase errors. Unlike the phase flip repetition code, the VSLQ code can correct for single photon loss because it uses the second excited state in the codewords, which remains distinct from the vacuum even after photon loss.'
