description: |
  Bosonic qudit-into-oscillator code whose stabilizers are oscillator displacement operators acting on a Hilbert space of \(n\) bosonic modes,
  \begin{align}
  \[D\lr{\bs{\xi}}=\exp\left\{-i \sqrt{2\pi} \bs{\xi}^\mathrm{T} J \hat{\bs{x}}\right\},\quad \bs{\xi}\) and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)=e^{2i\beta \hat{q}}\],
  \end{align}
  where the symplectic inner product between two vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\) is
  \begin{align}
  \[
  J=J_{2n}=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0\end{pmatrix} \otimes I_n= \begin{pmatrix}
  0 &  I_n \\
  -I_n  & 0 \end{pmatrix}
  \]~.
  \end{align}
  A group generated by a set of independent displacement operators is given by a lattice \({\mathcal{L}}\)
  \begin{align}
  \[\langle D\lr{\bs{\xi}_1},\dots,  D\lr{\bs{\xi}_{2n}} \rangle=\lrc{e^{i\phi_M\lr{\bs{\xi}}} D\lr{\bs{\xi}} \vert \bs{\xi} \in {\mathcal{L}}}
  \]
  \end{align}
  and becomes a valid stabilizer group when the corresponding lattice is symplectically integral, i.e. every symplectic inner product between lattice vectors yields an integer. The stabilizers of this code have continuous eigenvalues, which is related to the fact that the stabilizer group is infinite. The exact GKP states are non-normalizable, so approximate constructs have to be considered.

  The centralizer for this stabilizer group within the displacement operators can be identified with the symplectic dual lattice \({\mathcal{L}}^{\perp}\) (i.e. all points in \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\) that have integer symplectic inner product with all points in \({\mathcal{L}}\) ), such that logical operations are identified with the dual quotients \({\mathcal{L}}^{\perp}/{\mathcal{L}}\). The size of this dual quotient equals the determinant of the sympelectic Gram matrix \(\{A_{ij}=\bs{\xi}^T_iJ\bs{\xi}_j\}\), such that the encoded logical dimension is given by \(d=\sqrt{\| \det{A}\|}\) \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0008040}.

features:
  rate: 'Transmission schemes with multimode GKP codes achieve, up to a constant-factor offset, the capacity of displacement-noise and thermal-noise Gaussian loss channels \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0105058,arXiv:1708.07257,arXiv:1801.04731,arXiv:1801.07271}.'

  encoders:
    - 'Multi-mode GKP codes with fixed \(n\) and prime-dimensional logical Hilbert space are symplectically related to a disjoint product of single-mode GKP codes on \(n\) modes, such that encoding via Gaussian unitaries is possible.'

  general_gates:
    - 'By applying GKP error correction to Gaussian input states, universality can be achieved without non-Gaussian elements \cite{arXiv:1903.00012}.'

  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Logical Clifford operations are given by Gaussian unitaries, which map bounded-size errors to bounded-size errors.'

  decoders:
    - 'The MLD decoder for Gaussian displacement errors is realized by evaluating a lattice theta function, and in general the decision can be approximated by either solving (approximating) the closest vector problem (CVP) or by using other effective iterative schemes when e.g. the lattice represents a concatenated GKP code \cite{arXiv:1810.00047,arXiv:1908.03579,arXiv:2109.14645,arxiv:2111.07029}.'
