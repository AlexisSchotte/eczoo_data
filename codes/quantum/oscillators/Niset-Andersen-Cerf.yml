code_id: niset_andersen_cerf
physical: oscillators
logical: oscillators


name: 'Niest-Andersen-Cerf Code'

introduced: '\cite{arXiv:0710.4858}'

description: 'Encodes two photon coherent states (or a general squeezed state) into four photons. There are two variations, a deterministic protocol that offers recovery against a single photon error, or a probabalistic that can protect against multiple errors with post selection.'

protection: 'The deterministic protocol protects against a single erasure error on a known photon. This recovers one state perfectly and the other state with fidelity \(F = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2 r}}\) for initial EPR pair squeezed with variance \(e^{-2r}\). The probabalistic protocol utilizes post-selection to protect against multiple erasures with state-dependent fidelity.'

features:

  encoders: 
    - 'After an EPR pair preparation, use 2 continuous CNOT and 2 continuous inverse CNOT gates to entangle EPR pair with initial states \(|\alpha \rangle\) and \(\beta \rangle\)'
    - 'Alternate optical encoder using a two-mode squeezed vacuum state and two balanced beam splitters to mix the input coherent states with the EPR pair'


  decoders: 
    - 'Optical decoder using three beam splitters, electronic gain detectors and two phase-insensitive amplifiers as described in \cite{arXiv:0710.4858}'


realizations:
  - 'Realized in \cite{doi:10.1038/nphoton.2010.168} using optical approach with 3 beam-splitters. The fidelity of the deterministic approach peaked around 0.6 and around 0.77 for the probabilistic approach (with a 25% chance of error).'
