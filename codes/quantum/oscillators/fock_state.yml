name: 'Fock-state bosonic code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9505011,arXiv:quant-ph/9610043}'

description: 'Qudit-into-osillator code whose error correcting properties against oscillator amplitude damping (i.e., photon loss) stem from the use of disjoint sets of Fock states in the code state construction. For example, single-mode Fock-state codes include any qubit codes whose basis states are, respectively, supported on Fock states \(|0\rangle,|4\rangle,|8\rangle,\cdots\) and \(|2\rangle,|6\rangle,|10\rangle,\cdots\). As a result, the code states typically are most naturally expressed in terms of Fock states.'

protection: 'Code distance \(d\) is the minimum distance (in some metric) between any two Fock states of the code basis states. For a single mode, \(d\) is the minimum absolute value of the difference between any two Fock states of the code basis states. Such codes can detect up to \(d-1\) loss events.'
