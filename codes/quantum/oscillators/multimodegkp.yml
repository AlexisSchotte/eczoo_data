code_id: multimodegkp
physical: oscillators
logical: qudits

name: 'Multi-mode GKP code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0008040,arXiv:quant-ph/0105058}'

description: |
  Bosonic qudit-into-oscillator code whose stabilizers are oscillator displacement operators acting on a Hilbert space of \(n\) bosonic modes,
  \begin{align}
  D \xi = \exp \left\{-i \sqrt{2\pi} {\xi}^\mathrm{T} J \hat{x} \right\} , \quad \xi
  \end{align}
  and \(\hat{S}_p(2\beta)=e^{2i\beta \hat{q}}\), where the symplectic inner product between two vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\) is
  \begin{align}
  J = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \otimes I_n = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 &  I_n \\
  -I_n  & 0 \end{pmatrix}~.
  \end{align}
  A group generated by a set of independent displacement operators is given by a lattice \({\mathcal{L}}\)
  \begin{align}
  \langle D {\xi}_1 ,\dots,  D {\xi}_{2n}  \rangle = {e^{i\phi_M{{\xi}}} D{{\xi}} \vert {\xi} \in {\mathcal{L}}}
  \end{align}
  and becomes a valid stabilizer group when the corresponding lattice is symplectically integral, i.e. every symplectic inner product between lattice vectors yields an integer. The stabilizers of this code have continuous eigenvalues, which is related to the fact that the stabilizer group is infinite. The exact GKP states are non-normalizable, so approximate constructs have to be considered.

  The centralizer for this stabilizer group within the displacement operators can be identified with the symplectic dual lattice \({\mathcal{L}}^{\perp}\) (i.e. all points in \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\) that have integer symplectic inner product with all points in \({\mathcal{L}}\) ), such that logical operations are identified with the dual quotients \({\mathcal{L}}^{\perp}/{\mathcal{L}}\). The size of this dual quotient equals the determinant of the sympelectic Gram matrix \(\{A_{ij}={\xi}^T_i J{\xi}_j\}\), such that the encoded logical dimension is given by \(d=\sqrt{\| \det{A}\|}\) \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0008040}.

protection: 'The level of protection against displacement errors is quantified by the Euclidean code distance \(\Delta=\min_{x\in {\mathcal{L}}^{\perp}\setminus {\mathcal{L}}} \|x\|_2\) \cite{arXiv:2109.14645}.'
