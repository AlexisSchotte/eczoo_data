description: |
  A one-to-one mapping between basis states on \(n\) prime-dimensional qudits (of dimension \(q=p\)) and the subspace of the first \(p^n\) single-mode Fock states.
  While this mapping offers a way to map qudits into a single mode, noise models for the two code families induce different notions of locality and thus qualitatively different physical interpretations \cite{arxiv:2111.08894}.

  The mapping allows one to think of the Fock subspace as a tensor product of \(n\) \(p\)-dimensional qudits by performing a \(p\)-ary expansion of the Fock-state labels and treating each digit as an index of a qudit basis state.
  The Fock state integer label \(N\geq 0\) is expanded in the \(p\)-ary expansion as
  \begin{align}
      N=\sum_{\mu=0}^{\infty}b_{\mu}p^{\mu}~,
  \end{align}
  with each \(p\)-ary string \(b_{\mu}\in\mathbb{Z}_p\) corresponding to the basis-state label of qudit \(\mu\).
  
  In the binary case, the first qubit's \(Z\)-operator is the parity operator \(Z_0=(-1)^{\hat{n}}\), while the second qubit's \(Z\)-operator is the two-photon parity \(Z_1=(-1)^{\frac{1}{2}\hat{n}(\hat{n}-1)}\) \cite{arxiv:1106.3800,arxiv:2012.06994}. 
  These satisfy \(Z_{1}aZ_{1}=aZ_{0}\).

  Pauli operators for the constituent qudits can be expressed in terms of bosonic raising and lowering operators.
  The modular-qudit Pauli-\(Z\) operator for qudit \(\mu\) is the Fock-space rotation
  \begin{align}
    Z_{\mu}=\exp\left[i\frac{2\pi}{p}{\hat{n} \choose p^{\mu}}\right]~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\hat n\) is the mode's occupation number operator.
  This can be proven by Lucas's theorem.

  The Pauli-\(X\) operator is expressed as
  \begin{align}
    X_{\mu}=\frac{1-P_{\mu}^{(p-1)}}{\sqrt{\left(\hat{n}+p^{\mu}\right)_{p^{\mu}}}}a^{p^{\mu}}+\frac{P_{\mu}^{(p-1)}}{\sqrt{\left(\hat{n}\right)_{p^{\mu}(p-1)}}}a^{\dagger p^{\mu}\left(p-1\right)}~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\left(a\right)_{b}\) is the falling factorial, and where the qudit projector is
  \begin{align}
    P_{\mu}^{(k)}=\frac{1}{p}\sum_{l\in\mathbb{Z}_{p}}Z_{\mu}^{l}e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{p}kl}~.
  \end{align}
