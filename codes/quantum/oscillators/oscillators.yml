description: 'Also called an \textit{oscillator} or a \textit{continuous-variable (CV)} code. Encodes logical Hilbert space, finite- or infinite-dimensional, into a physical Hilbert space that contains at least one \textit{oscillator} (a.k.a. \textit{bosonic mode} or \textit{qumode}). States of a single oscillator are elements of the Hilbert space of \(\ell^2\)-normalizable functions on \(\mathbb{R}\)). Ideal codewords may not be normalizable because the space is infinite-dimensional, so approximate versions have to be constructed in practice.'

  A convenient and often considered error set is the set of \textit{displacement operators}, a bosonic analogue of the Pauli string basis for \hyperref[code:qubits_into_qubits]{qubit} codes. For a single mode, its elements are products of exponentials of the momentum \(\hat p\) and position \(\hat x\) operators, acting on the mode's position states \(|y\rangle\) for \(y\in\mathbb{R}\) as
  \begin{align}
    e^{-i\xi\hat{p}}\left|y\right\rangle =\left|y+\xi\right\rangle \,\,\text{ and }\,\,e^{i\xi\hat{x}}\left|y\right\rangle =e^{i\xi y}\left|y\right\rangle ~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\xi\in\mathbb{R}\). For multiple modes, error set elements are tensor products of elements of the single-qudit error set.

  The displacement error set is a unitary basis for trace-class linear operators on the \(n\)-mode Hilbert space that is Dirac-orthonormal under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRev.177.1857}; it is a bosonic analogue of a nice error basis \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9608048}. As such, products of position and momentum displacements can be expressed in a combined notation as
  \begin{align}
  D(\xi) = \exp \left\{-i \sqrt{2\pi} {\xi}^\mathrm{T} J \hat{q} \right\} , \quad \xi \in \mathbb{R}^{2n}~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\hat{q}\) is a \(2n\)-dimensional vector position and momentum operators of the modes, and the symplectic inner product between two vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\) is
  \begin{align}
  J = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \otimes I_n = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 &  I_n \\
  -I_n  & 0 \end{pmatrix}~.
  \end{align}
  The distance associated with this set can be the minimum weight of a displacement operator that implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code. An alternative definition relevant for \hyperref[code:multimodegkp]{multimode GKP} codes is the Euclidean distance, i.e., the smallest norm of a \(\xi\) such that the corresponding displacement implements a nontrivial logical operation in the code.
