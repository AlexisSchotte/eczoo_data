name: 'Bosonic rotation code'

introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevX.10.011058}'

description: |
  A bosonic rotation code encodes one \(d\)-dimensional qudit into a subspace of the oscillator such that the discrete rotation operator \(\exp\left(\mathrm{i} 2\pi \hat{n}/dN \right)\) acts as the logical Pauli-Z operation. Here \(\hat{n}\) is the number operator diagonal in the Fock basis. The rotation symmetry ensures that encoded states have support only on every \(N^{\textrm{th}}\) Fock state, i.e. \(\sum_{j=0}^\infty c_j \ket{j d N + kN}\) for some coefficients \(\c_j\). This is because the logical Pauli-Z operator acting on a general state \(\sum_n a_n \ket{n}\) gives \(\sum_n a_n \exp\left(\mathrm{i} 2\pi n / dN \right) \ket{n}\). In order for a codeword \(\ket{j_L}\) to be an eigenvector of this operation, \(a_n\) must be zero whenever \(n \neq (kd+j)N\) for some \(k\).

  The codewords are uniquely specified by choosing a \emph{primitive} state \(\ket{\Theta}\). To ensure valid (orthogonal and nonzero) codewords, \(\ket{\Theta}\) must satisfy the following requirement: for each \(j \in \mathbb Z_d\), \(\ket{\Theta}\) must have support on the Fock state \(\ket{(dk_j+j)N}\) for at least one \(k_j \in \mathbb{N}_0\). From such a primitive, the codewords \(\ket{j_L} \mid j \in \mathbb{Z}_d\) are constructed as \(\ket{j_L} \propto \sum_{m=0}^{2N-1} \mathrm{e}^{2\pi \mathrm{i} m (\hat n  / N + j) / d} \ket{\Theta}\).

protection: 'Photon losses or gains less than \(N\) are detectable. Dephasing rotations \(\exp(\matrhm{i}\theta \hat{n})\) can be detected whenever \(\theta\) is roughly less than \(\pi/N\). To get precise bounds on \(\theta\), one needs to analyze the particular bosonic rotation code specifically.'

features:

  general_gates:
    - 'The logical Pauli-Z gate is the discrete rotation operator \(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \pi \hat n /N}\), and the logical Pauli-X gate is the number-translation operator \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \ket{n}\bra{n+N}\).'
    - 'For qubits, the logical phase gate is \(S = \mathrm{e}^{\pi \mathrm{i} \hat n^2 / 2N^2}\).'
    - 'The \(T = \mathrm{diag}(1,\exp(\mathrm{i}\pi/4))\) gate is via gate teleportation and a resource state \(\vert 0_N\rangle + \exp(\mathrm{i}\pi/4) \vert 1_N \rangle\).'
    - 'The controlled rotation gate between an order \(N\) rotation code and an order \(M\) rotation code is \(\mathrm{CROT}_{NM} = \mathrm{e}^{(2\pi\mathrm{i} / dNM) \hat n \otimes \hat n}\).'

  decoders:
    - 'One can distinguish (destructively) the codewords by performing a number measurement. If a number state \(\ket{n}\) is measured, then one rounds to the nearest integer of the form \((kd+j)/N\), and deduces that the true state was \(\ket{j_L}\).'
    - 'One can distinguish states in the dual basis by performing phase estimation on \(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \theta \hat n}\). One then rounds the resulting \(\theta\) to the nearest number \(2\pi j / dN\) in order to determine which dual basis state \(j \in \mathbb Z_d\) it came from.'

  encoders:
    - 'The optimal way to prepare codewords depends on the exact rotation code in question \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevX.10.011058}.'
