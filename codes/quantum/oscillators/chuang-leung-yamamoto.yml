code_id: chuang-leung-yamamoto
physical: oscillators
logical: qubits

name: 'Chuang-Leung-Yamamoto code'

introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.56.1114}'

description: 'Bosonic qubit-into-oscillator codes that encode \(k\) qubits into \(M\) oscillators, with each oscillator restricted to having at most \(N\) excitations. Code states are expressed as superpositions of oscillator Fock states. A code distance \(d\) can be defined as in its parent code, the \hyperref[code:fock_state]{Fock state bosonic code}. Codes can be denoted as \([[N,M,2^k,d]]\), which conflicts with \hyperref[code:stabilizer]{stabilizer code} notation.'

protection: 'Protects against amplitude damping for loss of up to \(t = d-1\) excitations.'

features:


  rate: '\(r=\frac{k}{m \log_2(N+1)}\), with \(m\) the number of modes, and \(N\) the maximum allowed excitation number. To correct the loss of up to \(t\) excitations with \(l_0+1\) codewords, a code exists with scaling \(N \sim t^3l_0/2\).'

  encoders: 
    - 'Photon Fock state input into a network of beamsplitters, phase shifters, and Kerr media. These operations all preserve total photon number. Beamsplitters and phase shifters take annihilation operators to linear combinations of annihilation operators, the transformation matrix is unitary. The operations corresponding to Kerr nonlinear media are diagonal in the Fock basis, but they implement phases that in general depend nonlinearly on the number of photons in each mode. State preparation may require ancillary modes and be conditioned on photon number measurement result.'

      detail: 'This is a Fock state bosonic code, since the codewords are superpositions of disjoint sets of Fock states.'
