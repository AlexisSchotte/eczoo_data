code_id: cat_concatenated
physical: oscillators

name: 'Concatenated cat code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1409.6759}'

description: |
  A concatenated code whose outer code is a cat code. In other words, a qubit code that can be thought of as a concatenation of an arbitrary inner code and another cat outer code. Most examples encode physical qubits of an inner stabilizer code into the two-component cat code.

protection: |
  The cat code suppresses dephasing errors exponentially with the size of its coherent states, so the inner code (e.g., a quantum repetition code \cite{arxiv:1904.09474,arxiv:1905.00450,arxiv:2009.10756,arxiv:2212.11927,arxiv:2212.11927}) can be highly biased toward one type of noise while still ensuring good performance.

  A concatenation of the repetition code with the two-component cat code is a candidate for a memory that may be self-correcting, but only in the limit of infinite energy per mode \cite{arxiv:2205.09767}.
