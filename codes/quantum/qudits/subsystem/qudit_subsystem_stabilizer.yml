logical: qudits

name: 'Subsystem modular-qudit stabilizer code'
# introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0508131}'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{gauge stabilizer code}.
  Modular qudit version of a subsystem qubit stabilizer code. Can be obtained by taking a modular qudit stabilizer code and assigning some of its logical qubits to be gauge qubits.
  For composite qudit dimensions, such codes need not encode an integer number of qudits.

features:
  decoders:
    - 'Syndrome measurements are obtained by first measuring gauge operators of the code and taking their products, which give the stabilizer measurement outcomes.
    The order in which gauge operators are measured is important since they do not commute.
    There is a sufficient condition for inferring the stabilizer syndrome from the measurements of the gauge generators \cite[Appendix]{arxiv:1012.0425}.'

      detail: 'Subsystem modular-qudit stabilizer codes reduce to modular-qudit stabilizer codes when there are no gauge qudits.'
