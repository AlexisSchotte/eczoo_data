logical: qudits

name: '\(\mathbb{Z}_q\)-qudit stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9705052}'

description: 'An \(((n,q^k,d))_q\) (with \(q\gt 1\)) stabilizer code is denoted as \([[n,k]]_q\) or \([[n,k,d]]_q\), where \(d\) is the code''s distance.
The number of stabilizer generators  equals to \( q^{n-k}\), which is proven in \cite{arXiv:1101.1519}.
Normalizer \(N(S)\) of the stabilizer \(S\) is the set that contains all operators that commute with \(S\).
The distance is the minimum weight of an error that implements a nontrivial logical operation on the code.
Logical subspace is the joint \(+1\) eigenspace of a set of \(q^{n-k}\) commuting qudit Pauli operators forming the code''s stabilizer group, which cannot contain \(-I\).
The stabilizer code can correct errors \(\varepsilon \in P_n(q)\) if and only if \(\hat{E}^\dagger \hat{F} \notin \hat{N}(S)\setminus \hat{S}\) for all \(E,F \in \varepsilon\).
A standardized definition of the qudit stabilizer group is developed in \cite{arXiv:1101.1519}.

protection: 'Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qudits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qudits.'
