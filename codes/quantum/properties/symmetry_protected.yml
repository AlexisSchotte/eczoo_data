introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1805.01474}'

description: |
  The physical degrees of freedom of the code correspond to a physical lattice with finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. A group \(G\) (the symmetry group) is required to have a unitary representation \(S\) on the Hilbert space of the lattice. We say an operator \(O\) respects the symmetry if \([S(g),O]=0\) for all \(g\in G\). The codespace is the degenerate ground space of a Hamiltonian \(H\) that respects the symmetry and consists of terms local on the lattice. The required symmetry-protected self-correcting property is described as follows.

  Suppose the physical state of the system \(\rho(0)\) at time \(t=0\) is a codeword, and is evolved to \(\rho(t)\) by \(H\) plus a small coupling to a thermal bath with a low enough temperature. In addition, suppose that the coupling consists of terms of the form \(A_\text{system}\otimes B_\text{bath}\), such that \(A_\text{system}\) is local on the lattice and respects the symmetry. Then the memory time is defined as
  \begin{align}
    \tau_\text{mem}=\sup\left\{\,t>0\mid\left\|\Phi_\text{ec}(\rho(t))-\rho(0)\right\|_1<\epsilon\,\right\},
  \end{align}
  where \(\Phi_\text{ec}\) is the error correcting map and \(\epsilon\) a fixed error rate.
  \(\tau_\text{mem}\) is required to grow without bound (typically exponentially) in the system size.
  In addition, the logical operators are required to have a decomposition into a product such that each factor is local on the lattice and respects the symmetry.

  To achieve this property, it is insufficient to use a global on-site symmetry, that is,
  \begin{align}
    S(g)=\bigotimes_\text{sites}u(g),
  \end{align}
  where \(u\) is a unitary representation of \(G\) independent of the site.
  One way to achieve the property is to use a 1-form symmetry, that is, a symmetry generated by the operators
  \begin{align}
    S_\mathcal{M}(h)=\bigotimes_{\text{sites}\in\mathcal{M}}u(h),
  \end{align}
  where \(\mathcal{M}\) runs over all closed codimension-1 submanifolds of the lattice and \(h\) runs over all elements of some fixed group with a unitary representation \(u\) independent of the site.

protection: |
  Since the code is intended to be used as a self-correcting quantum memory when the symmetry is enforced, the protection is characterized by the scaling of \(\tau_\text{mem}\) in the system size.

  Another characterization of the protection property is the symmetric energy barrier \(\Delta\) defined as follows.
  For a given logical operator and a given decomposition into a product of local operators, we consider the maximal energy attained when implementing this logical operator stepwise with this decomposition. Then \(\Delta\) is defined by minimizing this quantity over all logical operators and all such decompositions that each local operator respects the symmetry.

  At least for some models \cite{arXiv:1805.01474}, the linear growth of \(\Delta\) (with system size) implies the exponential growth of \(\tau_\text{mem}\) below a critical temperature.
