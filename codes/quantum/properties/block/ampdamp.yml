code_id: ampdamp
# Qubit or bosonic

name: 'Amplitude-damping (AD) code'

description: |
  Block quantum code on either qubits or bosonic modes that is designed to detect and correct qubit or bosonic amplitude (AD) errors, respectively.

  The \textit{amplitude damping channel} is a bosonic channel that models loss of particles in the bosonic mode (a.k.a. \textit{photon loss} or \textit{attenuation}).
  Its Kraus operators are proportional to powers of a mode's annihilation operator \(a\), with the power signifying the number of particles lost during the error,
  \begin{align}
    E_{\ell}=\left(\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}\right)^{\ell/2}\frac{a^{\ell}}{\sqrt{\ell!}}\left(1-\gamma\right)^{\hat{n}/2}\,,
  \end{align}
  where \(\gamma\in[0,1)\) is the noise rate \cite{doi:10.1088/0954-8998/1/2/005,arxiv:1708.05010}.
  Restricting the channel to the first two Fock states \(\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\}) yields the non-Pauli qubit amplitude damping channel, which requires protecting against the loss error \(E_1\propto X+iY\) instead of \(X\) and \(Y\) Pauli errors individually.
  Both channels are called AD since the context makes clear which one is being referred to.

protection: |
  A definition of distance associated with amplitude damping is the minimum weight of a tensor products of non-zero loss errors (\(\ell\neq 0\)) that implement a nontrivial logical operation in the code.
  Certain codes also have intrinsic protection against AD, such as constant-excitation codes or self-complementary codes.
