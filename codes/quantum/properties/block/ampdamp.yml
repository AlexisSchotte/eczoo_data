code_id: ampdamp
# Qubit or bosonic

name: 'Amplitude-damping (AD) code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9704002}'

description: |
  Block quantum code on either qubits or bosonic modes that is designed to detect and correct qubit or bosonic amplitude damping (AD) errors, respectively.

protection: |
  The \textit{amplitude damping (AD) channel} is a bosonic channel that models loss of particles in a bosonic mode (a.k.a. \textit{photon loss} or \textit{attenuation}).
  Its Kraus operators are proportional to powers of a mode's annihilation operator \(a\), with the power signifying the number of particles lost during the error,
  \begin{align}
    E_{\ell}=\left(\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}\right)^{\ell/2}\frac{a^{\ell}}{\sqrt{\ell!}}\left(1-\gamma\right)^{\hat{n}/2}\,,
  \end{align}
  where \(\gamma\in[0,1)\) is the noise rate \cite{doi:10.1088/0954-8998/1/2/005,arxiv:1708.05010}.
  For multiple modes, error set elements are tensor products of elements of the single-mode error set. 

  Restricting the channel to the first two Fock states \(\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\}\) yields the non-Pauli \textit{qubit amplitude damping channel}, which requires protecting against the loss error \(E_1\propto X+iY\) (instead of \(X\) and \(Y\) Pauli errors individually).
  Both channels are called AD since the context makes clear which one is being referred to.

  Protection against AD noise is approximate in that the \(\ell=0\) Kraus operator is never corrected exactly, only up to some order in \(\gamma\) \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9704002}.
  For example, a qubit code that corrects a single AD error is one for which all tensor products \(E_{\ell_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes E_{\ell_n}\) with \(\ell_1+\cdots + \ell_n \leq 1\) are correctable (per the \term{Knill-Laflamme conditions}) up to order \(O(\gamma^2)\).
   
  Certain codes also have intrinsic protection against AD, such as constant-excitation codes or self-complementary codes.
  Amplitude damping can be thought of as a quantum analogue to asymmetric noise \cite{arxiv:1310.7536}.

# A definition of distance associated with amplitude damping is the minimum weight of a tensor products of loss errors that implement a nontrivial logical operation in the code.
