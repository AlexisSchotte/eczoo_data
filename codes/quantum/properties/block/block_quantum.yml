code_id: block_quantum

name: 'Block quantum code'

description: |
  A code constructed in a physical space consisting of a tensor product of \(n\) identical subsystems, e.g., qubits, modular qudits, Galois qudits, or oscillators.

protection: |
  Block codes protect from errors acting on a few of the \(n\) subsystems. A block code with \textit{distance} \(d\) detects errors acting on up to \(d-1\) subsystems, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) subsystems.

features:
  transversal_gates: '\textit{Transversal gates} are logical gates on block codes that can be realized as tensor products of unitary operations acting on subsets of subsystems whose size is independent of \(n\).'
