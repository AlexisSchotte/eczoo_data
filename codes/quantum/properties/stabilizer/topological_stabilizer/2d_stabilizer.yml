code_id: 2d_stabilizer
# includes both Galois and modular

name: '2D lattice stabilizer code'

description: |
  Lattice stabilizer code in two spatial dimensions.

  Any prime-qudit code can be converted to several copies of the prime-qudit 2D surface code along with some trivial codes \cite{arXiv:1812.11193}.

features:
  decoders:
    - 'Tensor-network based decoder for 2D codes subject to correlated noise \cite{arxiv:1809.10704}.'
    - 'Standard stabilizer-based error correction can be performed even in the presence of perturbations to the codespace \cite{arxiv:2401.06300}.'

relations:
  parents:

    - code_id: surface
      detail: 'Translation-invariant 2D qubit lattice stabilizer codes are equivalent to several copies of the Kitaev surface code via a local constant-depth Clifford circuit \cite{arXiv:1103.4606,arXiv:1107.2707,arXiv:1607.01387}.
      There exists an algorithm with which one can determine the fusion and braiding rules of a 2D translationally invariant qubit code, and decompose the given code into copies of the surface code \cite{arxiv:2312.11170}.'

      detail: 'Translation-invariant 2D prime-qudit lattice stabilizer codes are equivalent to several copies of the prime-qudit surface code via a local constant-depth Clifford circuit \cite{arxiv:1812.11193}.'
    - code_id: holographic
      detail: '2D lattice stabilizer codes admit a bulk-boundary correspondence similar to that of holographic codes, namely, the boundary Hilbert space of the former cannot be realized via local degrees of freedom \cite{arxiv:2312.04617}.'
