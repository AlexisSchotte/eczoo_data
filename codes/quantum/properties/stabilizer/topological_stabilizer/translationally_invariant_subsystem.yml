description: |
  A geometrically local qubit, modular-qudit, or Galois-qudit subsystem stabilizer code with qudits organized on a lattice modeled by the additive group \(\mathbb{Z}^D\) for spatial dimension \(D\).
  On an infinite lattice, its gauge and stabilizer groups are generated by few-site Pauli operators and their translations, in which case the code is called \textit{translationally invariant subsystem code}.
  Boundary conditions have to be imposed on the lattice in order to obtain finite-dimensional versions, in which case the stabilizer group may no longer be generated by few-site Pauli operators.
  Lattice defects and boundaries between different codes can also be introduced.

      detail: 'Lattice subsystem codes reduce to lattice stabilizer codes when there are no gauge qudits. The former (latter) is required to admit few-site gauge-group (stabilizer-group) generators on a lattice with boundary conditions.'
