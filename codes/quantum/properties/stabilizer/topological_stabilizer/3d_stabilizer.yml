name: '3D topological stabilizer code'

description: |
  Translationally invariant stabilizer code in three spatial dimensions.

  Three-dimensional qubit codes can be characterized by four
  coarse classes \cite{arXiv:1908.08049}:

  1. \textit{Abelian topological phase}: Excitations are mobile in all 3 dimensions, as is typical in a topological code. Such codes are conjectured to be equivalent to a \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) gauge theory, i.e., multiple copies of the 3D surface code or its variant where the charge excitation is a fermion.

  2. \textit{Foliated type-I fracton phase}: Excitations are mobile in less than 3 dimensions, but codes can be grown by \textit{foliation}, i.e., stacking copies of the 2D surface code.

  3. \textit{Fractal type-I fracton phase}: Excitations are mobile in less than 3 dimensions, and codes are not foliated.

  4. \textit{Type-II fracton phase}: Excitations are not mobile in any dimension and there are no string operators.
