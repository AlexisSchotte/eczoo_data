name: 'Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code'

description: |
  Family of \([[n,k,d]]\) stabilizer codes for which the number of sites (either qubit or qudit) participating in each stabilizer generator and the number of stabilizer generators that each site participates in are both bounded by a constant as \(n\to\infty\).

  Strictly speaking, the term \textit{parity check} describes only bitwise qubit error syndromes. Nevertheless, qudit codes satisfying the above criteria are often called QLDPC codes.

protection: 'Detects errors on \(d-1\) sites, corrects errors on \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) sites. Asymptotic scaling of \(k\) and \(d\) with \(n\) is often of interest, and this depends heavily on the code construction.

A \textit{good quantum LDPC code} family satisfies \(k \in \theta(n) \) and \(d \in \theta(n)\) \cite{arXiv:2103.06309}, and the first examples of good qubit codes are a family of \hyperref[code:lifted_product]{lifted-product codes}.

For qubits, a \textit{geometrically local LDPC code} is an LDPC code where the qubits involved in any syndrome bit are contained in a fixed volume that does not scale with \(n\); such codes are limited to having \(d=O(n^{1-1/D})\) for \(D\)-dimensional lattice geometries \cite{arxiv:0810.1983}.'

      detail: 'Topological codes are not generally defined using Pauli strings. However, for appropriate tesselations, the codespace forms a ground-state subspace of a geometrically local Hamiltonain. In this sense, topological codes are QLDPC codes. On the other hand, chain complexes describing some QLDPC codes can be ''lifted'' into higher-dimensional manifolds admitting some notion of geometric locality \cite{arXiv:2012.02249}. This opens up the possibility that some QLDPC codes, despite not being \textit{geometrically} local, can in fact be associated with a geometrically local theory described by a category.'
