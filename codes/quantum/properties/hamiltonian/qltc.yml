description: |
  A local commuting-projector Hamiltonian-based quantum error-correcting code on a finite-tensor-product space of \(n\) identical factors (e.g., qubits, modular qudits, or Galois qudits) which has a nonzero average-energy penalty for creating large errors. Informally, for a QLTC, if an error state is far away from the codespace, then the state is an excited state of a lot of local projectors. The average-energy penalty is quantified by the code's \textit{soundness} \(R\). Typically, one looks at how \(R\) scales with increasing code size for infinite families of codes, defining QLTC families as those for which the soundness is asymptotically constant.

  More technically, a QLTC is a code \(\mathsf{C}\) defined as the ground-state space of a commuting-projector Hamiltonian \(H\) consisting of a sum of \(m\) local projectors, each of which acts on exactly \(k\) qubits (for some constant \(k\)). Such a code is QLTC with soundness function \(R(\delta)\in[0,1]\) if
  \begin{align}
  \label{eq:qltc}
    \forall \delta > 0,|\psi\rangle~:~\text{dist}(|\psi\rangle,C) \geq \delta n \Rightarrow \frac{1}{m}\langle\psi|H|\psi\rangle\geq R(\delta)~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\text{dist}(|\psi\rangle,\mathsf{C})\) is a particular distance function between the state \(|\psi\rangle\) and the codespace \(\mathsf{C}\) \cite[Def. 13]{arxiv:1310.5664}. The locality parameter \(k\) is called the \textit{query complexity} of the code.

  A qubit, modular-qudit, or Galois-qudit stabilizer code that is locally testable is called a \textit{stabilizer locally testable code (SLTC)}. In other words, the code admits a set of \(m\) \(k\)-local stabilizer generators \(S_i\) whose corresponding code Hamiltonian \(H=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^m I-S_i\) satisfies the requirement of being QLTC.

  For example, the \([[2L^2,2,L]]\) toric code on an \(L\times L\) lattice is \textit{not} a QLTC because of the following argument. Let \(|\psi\rangle\) be a ground state that is excited by \(L/3\) Pauli strings, each of length \(L/2\). In order to fit on the lattice, such strings can, e.g., be horizontal and aligned next to each other in the vertical direction. The distance function \(\text{dist}(|\psi\rangle,\mathsf{C})\) is the weight of the smallest Pauli string that multiplies \(|\psi\rangle\) to yield a state in the codespace. In this case, that weight is the same as the weight of the perturbing string, i.e., \(L^2/6\), requiring \(\delta = 1/12\) to satisfy \eqref{eq:qltc}. There are \(2L/3\) violated Hamiltonian terms because each of the \(L/3\) strings violates only two stabilizer generators. However, there are \(m = 2(L^2-1)\) stabilizer generators, so the implication of \eqref{eq:qltc} is not satisfied for nonzero soundness as \(L\to\infty\) because \(\frac{1}{m}\langle\psi|H|\psi = \frac{2L/3}{2(L^2-1)}\to 0\).

notes:
  - 'It was shown in Ref. \cite{doi:10.1109/FOCS.2017.46} that existence of a QLTC with constant parameters would implies resolution of the \textit{No low-energy trivial states} (NLTS) conjecture \cite{arxiv:1301.1363}.'
