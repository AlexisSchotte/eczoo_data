code_id: topological

name: 'Topological code'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9707021}'

description: |
  A code whose codewords form the ground-state or low-energy subspace of a code Hamiltonian realizing a topological phase.

  For 2D lattice systems with finite local dimension, topological phases are defined by their \textit{anyons} \cite{doi:10.1007/BF02727953,doi:10.1063/1.524510,doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.957,doi:10.1063/1.2810672}, which are local bulk excitations of the code Hamiltonian defined on a lattice; see Ref. \cite[Appx. F]{arxiv:cond-mat/0506438} for an introduction and Refs. \cite{doi:10.1007/BF01877742,doi:10.1007/BF01646454,arxiv:1804.03203} for more rigorous formulations.

  Anyons are created in pairs by local operators, and two anyons lie in the same \textit{superselection sector} if a  local operator can convert one anyon into the other.
  Each superselection sector is assumed to be labeled by one anyon type, and local operators cannot change superselection sectors.

  Anyons can braid with each other, with their \textit{exchange statistics} defined by phases \(\theta(a)\) obtained by exchanging two anyons of each type \(a\).

  Anyons \(a\) and \(b\) can also fuse with each other, meaning that one considers both anyons as one anyon \(ab\) and decomposes \(ab\) into the anyons representing each superselection sector according to the anyons' \textit{fusion rules}.
  For example, two anyons \(a,b\) may fuse to the trivial (i.e., vacuum) anyon \(1\), \(ab=1\), meaning that the composite excitation \(ab\) is indistinguishable from the case of no excitation.

  The exchange statistics and fusion rules of anyons cannot be arbitrary and have to satisfy certain consistency relations.
  Admissible braiding and fusion data is characterized by a \textit{unitary braided fusion category}.

  An anyon theory which has degenerate braiding relations is called \textit{non-modular}, while one that has protected excitations on the boundary of the underlying manifold is called \textit{chiral}.

protection: 'Topological order cannot be stabilized via weight-two or weight-three stabilizer generators on nearly Euclideam geometries of qubits or qutrits \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0308021,arXiv:1102.0770}.'

    - 'The unitary circuit depth required to initialize in a general topologically ordered state using geometrically local gates on an \(L\times L\) lattice is \(\Omega(L)\) \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0603121}, irrespective of whether the ground state admits Abelian or non-Abelian anyonic excitations.
    However, only a finite-depth circuit and one round of measurements is required for nonabelian topological orders with a Lagrangian subgroup \cite{arxiv:2209.03964}.'
