code_id: hamiltonian

name: 'Hamiltonian-based code'
#introduced: ''

description: |
  Code whose codespace corresponds to a set of energy eigenstates of a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian i.e., a Hermitian operator whose expectation value measures the energy of its underlying physical system.
  The codespace is typically a set of low-energy eigenstates or ground states, but can include subspaces of arbitrarily high energy.
  Hamiltonians whose eigenstates are the canonical basis elements are called \textit{classical}; otherwise, a Hamiltonian is called \textit{quantum}.

  A Hamiltonian whose ground states minimize the energy of each term is called a frustration-free Hamiltonian.
  A Hamiltonian whose terms commute and can be written as orthogonal projectors (i.e., with eigenvalues zero or one) is called a commuting projector Hamiltonian.

  For block quantum codes, the code Hamiltonian is typically written as a sum of terms, with each term acting on at most some number \(K\) of subsystems (i.e., being of weight at most \(K\)).
  When \(K\) is independent of the total number of subsystems (e.g., \hyperref[code:qldpc]{QLDPC codes}), the Hamiltonian is called a \(K\)\textit{-body} or \(K\)\textit{-local} Hamiltonian.
  When the physical space is endowed with a geometry, the Hamiltonian is typically \textit{geometrically local}, consisting of operators acting on subsystems that occupy a region whose size is independent of the number of subsystems.

  Ground states of infinite families geometrically local block-code Hamiltonians on tesselations of Euclidean geometries can be said to be a particular \textit{phase of quantum matter}, i.e., a "region in some parameter space in which the ... states possess properties that can be distinguished from those in other phases" \cite{doi:10.1063/PT.3.1641}.
  For example, \hyperref[code:topological]{topological code} Hamiltonians realize a type of phase called topological order.

# A simple example of a non-commuting frustration-free Hamiltonian is the Heisenberg model.
# A simple example of a commuting non-frustration-free Hamiltonian is a classical Ising model on a circle with an odd number of sites.

  Often determined from the underlying physical properties of the Hamiltonian.

  Ground states of many Hamiltonians can be easily written as tensor-network states or, in 1D, matrix product states (MPS).
  A no-go theorem states that open-boundary MPS that form a degenerate ground-state space of a gapped local Hamiltonian yield codes with distance that is only constant in the number of qubits \(n\), so MPS excitation ansatze have to be used to achieve a distance scaling nontrivially with \(n\) \cite{arxiv:1902.02115} (see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:1407.3413}).
