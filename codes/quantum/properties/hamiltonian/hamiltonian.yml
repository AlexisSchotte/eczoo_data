code_id: hamiltonian

name: 'Hamiltonian-based code'
#introduced: ''

description: |
  Code whose codespace corresponds to a set of energy eigenstates of a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian.
  The codespace is typically a set of low-energy eigenstates or ground states, but can include subspaces of arbitrarily high energy.

  For block quantum codes, the Hamiltonian can be \textit{local}, i.e., consisting of operators acting on a number of subsystems that is independent of the total number of subsystems (e.g., \hyperref[code:qldpc]{QLDPC codes}).
  When the physical space is endowed with a geometry, the Hamiltonian is typically \textit{geometrically local}, consisting of operators acting on subsystems that occupy a region whose size is independent of the number of subsystems (e.g., \hyperref[code:topological]{topological codes}).

  Ground states of infinite families geometrically local block-code Hamiltonians can sometimes be said to be a particular phase of (quantum) matter.
  A phase is a "region in some parameter space in which the ... states possess properties that can be distinguished from those in other phases" \cite{doi:10.1063/PT.3.1641}.

  A Hamiltonian whose ground states minimize the energy of each term is called a \textit{frustration-free} Hamiltonian.
  A Hamiltonian whose terms commute and can be written as orthogonal projectors (i.e., with eigenvalues zero or one) is called \textit{commuting projector} Hamiltonian.

  Often determined from the underlying physical properties of the Hamiltonian.

  Ground states of many Hamiltonians can be easily written as tensor-network states or, in 1D, matrix product states (MPS).
  A no-go theorem states that open-boundary MPS that form a degenerate ground-state space of a gapped local Hamiltonian yield codes with distance that is only constant in the number of qubits \(n\), so MPS excitation ansatze have to be used to achieve a distance scaling nontrivially with \(n\) \cite{arxiv:1902.02115} (see also Ref. \cite{arxiv:1407.3413}).
