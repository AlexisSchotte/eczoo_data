code_id: hamiltonian

name: 'Hamiltonian-based code'
#introduced: ''

description: |
  Encoding corresponds to a set of energy eigenstates of a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian. The codespace is typically a set of low-energy eigenstates or ground states, but can include subspaces of arbitrarily high energy.

  When the physical space is a tensor product of subsystems, the Hamiltonian is typically \textit{local}, consisting of operators acting on a number of subsystems that is independent of the total number of subsystems (e.g., \hyperref[code:qldpc]{QLDPC codes}). When the physical space is endowed with a geometry, the Hamiltonian is typically \textit{geometrically local}, consisting of operators acting on subsystems that occupy a region whose size is independent of the number of subsystems (e.g., \hyperref[code:topological]{topological codes}). When the terms in a geometrically local Hamiltonian commute and can be expressed as projectors (i.e., having eigenvalues 0 or 1), the Hamiltonian is called \textit{commuting-projector}.

protection: 'Often determined from the underlying physical properties of the Hamiltonian.'
