code_id: topological_abelian

name: 'Abelian topological code'
#introduced: ''

description: |
  Code whose codewords realize topological order associated with an Abelian anyon theory, equivalently, a braided fusion category which is an Abelian group under fusion \cite{arxiv:2004.12048}.
  Any theory is defined by an Abelian group and, for each anyon type \(a\), the phases \(\theta(a)\) obtained by exchanging two anyons of said type.

  All 2D abelian topological orders can be understood within the stabilizer formalism \cite{arxiv:2211.03798}.
  As such, many of the operations one can perform on such codes have both a stabilizer and a topological-phase interpretation.

  Stabilizer generators of 2D topological codes acting on 1D loops of qubit can be interpreted as one-form symmetries of the underlying phase realized by the code.

  Identification of an anyon \(a\) with the vacuum is equivalent to adding string excitation operators corresponding to \(a\) to the stabilizer group and taking the center to get another stabilizer group.
  Code states of this new stabilizer code correspond to a \textit{condensed phase} of the parent topological phase.
  The remaining unidentified parent-phase anyons behave differently with respect to the new condensed-phase state.
  Some become \textit{confined} while the remaining ones pick up new braiding relations.
