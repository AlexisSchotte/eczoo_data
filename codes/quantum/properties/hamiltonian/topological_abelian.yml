code_id: topological_abelian

name: 'Abelian topological code'
#introduced: ''

description: |
  Code whose codewords realize topological order associated with an Abelian anyon theory, i.e., an anyon theory which generates an Abelian group under fusion.
  Any theory is defined by an Abelian group and, for each anyon type \(a\), the phases \(\theta(a)\) obtained by exchanging two anyons of said type CITE In and around Abelian anyon models.

  Any local quantum circuit connecting ground states of topological orders with non-isomorphic Abelian groups must have depth that is at least linear in the system's diameter \cite{arXiv:1407.2926}.

# non-modular anyon theories (i.e., those with degenerate braiding relations) as well as chiral anyon theories (i.e., those with no possible gapped boundary to the vacuum).

features:
  general_gates:
    - 'Clifford gates can be implemented by braiding defects; for qubit-based stabilizer codes realizing Abelian topological phases, see Refs. \cite{arxiv:1305.7203,arxiv:2210.09282}. Most of such designs focus on the surface code \cite{arxiv:1004.1838,arXiv:1104.5047,arXiv:1208.0928,arXiv:1508.04166,arXiv:1609.04673,arXiv:2103.08381}.'
  fault_tolerance:
    - 'Fault-tolerant logical operations can be interpreted as anyon condensation events \cite{arxiv:2212.00042}.'
    - 'Modular decoding applicable to all fault-tolerant protocols based on topological qubit stabilizer codes \cite{arxiv:2303.04846}.'
  code_capacity_threshold:
    - 'Noise thresholds can be formulated as anyon condensation transitions in a topological field theory \cite{arxiv:2301.05687}, generalizing the mapping of the effect of noise on a code state to a statistical mechanical model \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143,arXiv:1208.2317,arXiv:1311.7688,arXiv:1809.10704}.'
