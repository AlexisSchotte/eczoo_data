code_id: lego

name: 'LEGO code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2109.08158}'

description: |
  The quantum LEGO method is a method of combining multiple codes that have been converted into Tensors by tying together the input and outputs of those codes, in a way stacking them similar to LEGOs.



features:

  encoders:
    - 'First each code mapping \(V\) is converted to a tensor by decomposing it using the formula \(V = \sum_{i_j} V_{i_1 \dots i_{n+k}} | i_{k+1}\dots i{k+n} \rangle \langle i_1 \dots i_k |\). '
    - 'We then look at the codes graphically, treating each \(i_j\) as an edge dangling out of the tensor vertex \(V_{i_1 \dots i_{n+k}\). These edges are either connected to another tensor vertex''s edges or left dangling.'
    - 'Each local tensor has unitary product stabilizers (UPS). The goal is to push each UPS through the tensor network until each dangling edge has only trivial support. Otherwise, a matching value is pushed through the edge and the process is repeated on the next tensor. If a UPS can be pushed through the whole network, then a UPS for the larger network has been found.'
    - 'The dangling legs (edges) and UPS of the whole network can then be converted to physical/logical elements and stabilizers/logical operators for a new quantum ECC.'

  decoders:
    - 'The decoder is created by creating a decoding quantum circuit with dangling legs replaced with input/output wires, and tensors converted to unitary gates.'
    - 'Maximum likelihood decoding can be used when the tensors are stabilizer codes.'

notes:
  - 'The bounds for these codes depend entirely on the codes used to create them.'
  - 'These codes can serve as a bridge between quantum error correction and physics. For example, the introduction paper states that finding the tensor constructions of well-known gauge codes using the lego method can help with the understanding of low energy Hamiltonian behavior with frustration in the ground space.'
  - 'Many known codes can be created using this code''s methods in order to further their understanding. Examples can be found in the paper that introduces these codes.'
  - 'Tensor-network codes are types of LEGO codes where logical and physical legs are pre-assigned and logical legs are not contracted.'
