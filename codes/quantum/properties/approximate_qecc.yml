description: 'Encodes quantum information so that it is possible to approximately recover that information from noise up to an error bound in recovery.'

protection: |
  Given some encoding map \(\cal{E}\) and some noise channel \(\cal{N}\),
  the code described by \(\cal{E}\) is \(\epsilon\)-correctable iff there exists
  some quantum channel \(\cal{R}\) such that 
  \begin{align}d(\cal{R}\cal{N}\cal{E},\mathrm{id})\leq \epsilon\end{align}
  for Bures distance \(d\)~\cite{arXiv:0907.5391}.

  \subsection{Necessary and sufficient approximate error correction conditions}
  Analogously to the Knill-Laflamme conditions, there exist necessary and sufficient conditions for
  approximate error correction to determine if some code is \(\epsilon\)-correctable under a noise channel.

  Given some code defined by projector \(P\), \(P\) is \(\epsilon\)-correctable
  with respect to some noise channel \(\cal{N}\) iff
  \begin{align}PE_i^{\dagger}E_j P=\lambda_{ij}P+PB_{ij}P\end{align}
  where \(\Lambda(\rho)=\mathrm{Tr}(\rho)\sum_{ij} \lambda_{ij}|i\rangle\langle j|\) 
  is a density operator, \((\Lambda+B)(\rho)=\Lambda(\rho)+\sum_{ij}\mathrm{Tr}(\rho B_{ij})|i\rangle\langle j|\), 
  and \(d(\Lambda+B,\Lambda)\le\epsilon\)~\cite{arXiv:0907.5391}.

  Necessary and sufficient conditions for approximate error correction can also be expressed in terms of
  complementary channels.

  Given some noise channel \(\mathcal{N}\), there exists some recovery channel \(\mathcal{R}\) such that
  \(F(\mathcal{R}\mathcal{N},\mathcal{M})=1-\epsilon\) iff there exists some \(\mathcal{R}'\) such that
  for complementary channels \(\mathcal{N}^C\) and \(\mathcal{M}^C\), \(F(\mathcal{N}^C,R'\mathcal{M}^C)=1-\epsilon\). 
  Note that \(F\) denotes worst case entaglement fidelity between channels.
  
  One example is that if \(\mathcal{M}\) is the projector onto some algebra \(\mathcal{A}\), 
  we can derive correctability conditions for that algebra under \(\mathcal{N}\)~\cite{arXiv:0907.5391}.

  \subsection{Sufficient approximate error correction conditions}
  In addition to the necessary and sufficient error correction conditions, 
  there exist sufficient conditions for approximate error correction that can also be useful.

  Given \(\mathcal{E}(\rho)=\sum_{n} A_n \rho A_n^{\dagger}\) where \(\forall{n}\), \(A_n\) is a Kraus operator.
  Suppose that for projector \(P\) onto the code, \(A_n P=U_n \sqrt{PA_n^{\dagger}A_n P}\) 
  as a polar decomposition and \(p_n\) and \(p_n\lambda_n\) are the 
  largest and smallest eigenvalues for \(PA_n^{\dagger}A_n P\). 

  Then, we are guaranteed that if 
  \begin{align}PU_m^{\dagger}U_n P=\delta_{mn} P \land p_n(1-\lambda_n)\le O(f(\epsilon))\end{align}
  we have a fidelity \(F \geq 1-O(f(\epsilon))\) after recovery~\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9704002}.

  \subsection{Universal subspace approximate error correction}
  Universal subspace approximate error correction is a type of approximate error correction
  where up to a fixed subspace size, given the information that a quantum state is in a subspace of that size,
  it is approximately recoverable after being transmitted through a noisy quantum channel.

  Given some qudit in Hilbert space \(S\) of dimension \(d\). 
  Given noise channel \(\mathcal{N}\).
  Given encoding \(\mathcal{E}\).
  Then, we define this qudit as an \(\alpha\)-dit with error \(\epsilon\)
  iff forall subspaces \(\tilde{S}\) of dimension less than or equal to \(d^{\alpha}+1\),
  there exists some channel \(\tilde{\mathcal{D}}\) such that
  \begin{align}||(\tilde{\mathcal{D}}\circ \mathcal{N}\circ \mathcal{E})|\psi\rangle-|\psi\rangle||_1\leq \epsilon\end{align}
  forall \(|\psi\rangle\in \tilde{S}\)~\cite{arXiv:1706.09434}.

  See Ref. \cite{arxiv:1610.06169} for bounds on approximate code length, size, and distance.

The infidelity of a modified Petz recovery map can be bounded using relative entropies between uncorrupted and corrupted code states on countably infinite Hilbert spaces \cite{arxiv:1509.07127}.'
