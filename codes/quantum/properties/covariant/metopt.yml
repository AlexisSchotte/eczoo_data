code_id: metopt

name: 'Metrologically optimal QECC'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:1704.06280,arxiv:1706.02445}'

description: |
  Code that can be obtained via an optimization procedure that ensures correction against a set \(\cal{E}\) of errors as well as guaranteeting optimal precision in estimating a parameter using a noiseless ancilla. For tensor-product spaces consisting of \(n\) subsystems (e.g., qubits, modular qudits, or Galois qudits), the procedure can yield a code whose parameter estimation precision satisfies \textit{Heisenberg scaling}, i.e., scales quadratically with the number \(n\) of subsystems.

  The conditions required for a code are that it corrects errors in the set \(\cal{E}\) and admits a \(U(1)\) group of logical gates generated by some Hamiltonian \(H\) (whose corresponding parameter is what is being estimated).
  This means that \(H\) cannot itself be a detectable error, i.e., \(H\) cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the errors, a condition known as the \textit{Hamiltonian-not-in-Kraus-span} condition \cite{arxiv:2005.11918} (alternatively, Hamiltonian-not-in-Lindblad-span for Markovian noise \cite{arxiv:1706.02445}). The optimization procedure has been generalized to more general groups, corresponding to multiparameter estimation \cite{arxiv:1901.00896}.
