description: 'Encodes Hilbert space of \(\ell^2\)-normalizable functions on a group \(G_1\) into that on a second-countable unimodular group \(G_2\). For finite \(G_1\) and \(G_2=G^{\times n}\), can be denoted as \(((n,|G_1|))_G\). Furthermore, when \(K=|G|^k\), can be denoted \([[n,k]]_G\). Ideal codewords may not be normalizable, depending on whether \(G_2\) is continuous and/or noncompact, so approximate versions have to be constructed.'
