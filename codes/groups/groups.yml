name: 'Group code'

description: 'Encodes a logical Hilbert space, finite- or infinite-dimensional, into the Hilbert space of \(\ell^2\)-normalizable functions on a second-countable unimodular group. For \(K\)-dimensional logical subspace and for groups \(G^{\times n}\), can be denoted as \(((n,K))_G\). When the logical subspace is the Hilbert space of \(\ell^2\)-normalizable functions on \(G^{\times k}\), can be denoted as \([[n,k]]_G\). Ideal codewords may not be normalizable, depending on whether \(G\) is continuous and/or noncompact, so approximate versions have to be constructed.'
