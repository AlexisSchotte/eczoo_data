logical: matrices

name: 'Rank metric code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1016/0097-3165(78)90015-8}'

description: |
  Encodes \(k\) states in an \(m \times n\)-dimensional \textit{matrix} over \(GF(q)\), using the rank of the difference of matrices as the distance function.
  Distance \(d\) is the minimum rank of all nonzero matrices in the code.
  Generally linear.

protection: 'Protects against errors with rank \(\leq \lfloor \frac{d-1}2 \rfloor\).'

features:

  decoders:
    - 'The method of decoding is analogous to the Berlekamp-Welch algorithm.'
    - 'Error locator polynomial \(E(y_i) = E(f(\alpha_i))\).'
    - 'This problem is linearized to \(E(y_i) = N(\alpha_i)\). Using the known degrees of these polynomials \(deg_q f \leq k-1, deg_q E \leq t\), this problem becomes a set of linear equations which can be solved for \(E\) and \(f\).'
    - 'Finally we perform \(E(y_i - f_i(\alpha_i)) = 0\) to solve for the error vector.'

notes:
  - 'Number of codewords \(k \leq max(n, m) (min(n, m) - d + 1) \).'
  - 'Codes that achieve the above bound with equality are called Maximum Rank Distance (MRD).'
  - 'Number of codewords \(k \leq max(n, m) M\), where \(M\) is the maximum rank of all matrices in the code.'
  - 'Codes that achieve this bound with equality are called Delsarte optimal anticodes.'
  - 'Several useful properties (linearity, encoding, decoding, etc.) are present in \hyperref[code:gabidulin]{Gabidulin} codes, a child of rank metric codes.'
  - 'See \cite{arXiv:1410.1333v3} for a discussion of MacWilliams identities and the relationship between rank metric and Gabidulin codes.'

      detail: 'Gabidulin codes can be seen as a subset of rank metric codes where the rows are treated as single elements of \(GF(q^n)\). Each Gabidulin codeword will be an evaluation of a bounded-degree linearized polynomial with coefficients in \(GF(q^m)\) over a set of \(n\) elements in \(GF(q^m)\) that are independent over \(GF(q)\). These \(n\) elements can each be converted into rows of a rank metric code over \(GF(q)\) by taking a basis of \(GF(q^m)\) in \(GF(q)\) and using the coefficients of the linear expansion as a row vector. This method can be reversed to convert rank metric codes to Gabidulin codes.'
