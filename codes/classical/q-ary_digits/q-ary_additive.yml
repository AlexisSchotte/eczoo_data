#introduced: ''

description: 'A code whose codewords are closed under addition, i.e., for any codewords \(x,y\), \(x+y\) is also a codeword.'

notes: 
  - 'A self orthogonal code is defined as a code \(C\) satisfying, \(C \subset C^{\perp}\).'
  - 'Suppose \(\bar{S} \subset \bar{E} = \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{2n}\) is a linear binary subspace. If \(\phi : \bar{S} \rightarrow GF(4)^{n}\), then
     \(\phi\) is one-one, onto so it is an invertible map that gives an additive code over \(GF(4)\).' 
  - 'Interpreting \(\bar{S}\) as a binary symplectic representation, it represents a string of \(n\) paulis or a matrix of dimension of \(2^{n} x 2^{n}\).'

      detail: 'Suppose \(C\) is an additive self-orthogonal subcode of \(GF(4)^n\), containing \(2^{n-k}\) vectors, such that there are no vectors of 
      weight \(\leq\) \(d - 1\) in \(C^{\perp}\setminus C\). Then any eigenspace of \(\phi^{-1}(C)\) is a quantum-error-correcting code with parameters \([[n, k, d]]\).'
