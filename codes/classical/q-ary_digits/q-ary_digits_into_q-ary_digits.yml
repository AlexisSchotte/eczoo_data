name: '\(q\)-ary code'

description: |
  Encodes \(K\) states (codewords) in \(n\) \(q\)-ary coordinates over the field \(GF(q)\) and has distance \(d\). Usually denoted as \((n,K,d)_q\). The (Hamming) distance is the minimum number of coordinates where two strings in the code differ.

  \subsection{Finite-field alphabet}
  \begin{defterm}{Finite fields}
  \label{topic:finite-fields}
  Galois or finite fields \(GF(q)=\mathbb{F}_q\) are sets of \(q\) elements closed under addition and multiplication.
  They are finite analogues of the real or complex numbers, and a unique field exists for every power \(q=p^m\) of a prime \(p\).
  The prime-field case reduces to \(\mathbb{Z}_p\), a group under addition that is promoted to a field by defining multiplication modulo \(p\).
  Every finite field comes with a 0 element (additive identity), a 1 element (multiplicative identity), and additive (multiplicative) inverses for all (nonzero) elements.  
  An element whose powers exhaust all nonzero field elements is called \textit{primitive}.
  Fields come with a trace operation, the \textit{field trace}, which maps elements \(\gamma \in GF(q)\) to elements of \(GF(p)\) as
  \begin{align}
    \text{tr}(\gamma)=\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\gamma^{p^{k}}~.
  \end{align}
  The field trace can be thought of as an averaging over the field's Galois group, which is the cyclic group generated by \(\gamma\to\gamma^p\) \cite[pg. 113]{preset:MacSlo}.
  Fields also come with a \textit{field norm},
  \begin{align}
    N(\gamma)=\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}\gamma^{p^{k}}=\gamma^{(p^{m}-1)/(p-1)}~.
  \end{align}
  In the case of the complex numbers, analogues of the field trace and field norm are the real part and  norm squared of a complex number, respectively.

  Any field \(GF(q)\) can be thought of as an \(m\)-dimensional vector space over \(GF(p)\) a.k.a. the \(m\)th \textit{extension} of \(GF(p)\) (similar to the complex numbers being an extension of the reals).
  Conversely, \(GF(p)\) is an example of a \textit{subfield} of \(GF(q)\).
  Certain field elements are chosen to be the \textit{basis} of \(GF(q)\) over \(GF(p)\), and all other elements are expressed as linear combinations of these basis elements.
  More generally, elements of fields such as \(GF(p^{ml})\) can be written as \(m\)-dimensional vectors over \(GF(p^l)\) or \((m\times l)\)-dimensional matrices over \(GF(p)\). 
  This idea is used to convert between ordinary block codes and matrix-based codes such as disk array codes and rank-metric codes.
  The field norm and field trace can likewise be defined for fields \(GF(q^m)\) that are extensions of \(GF(q)\) for non-prime \(q\).
  \end{defterm}

  An example of a field is the quaternary Galois field \(GF(4) = \{0,1,\omega, \omega^2=\bar{\omega}\}\) with \(p=m=2\).
  In this case, \(\omega\) can be interpreted as a third root of unity, but more formally it is defined as a solution to the polynomial equation \(1+x+x^2=0\).
  Field elements can be represented as two-dimensional vectors with binary elements, \(GF(4)=GF(2^2)\), using the basis \(1\cong(1,0)\) and \(\omega\cong(0,1)\):
  \begin{align}
    0&\leftrightarrow(0,0)\cong0\cdot1+0\cdot\omega\\1&\leftrightarrow(0,1)\cong0\cdot1+1\cdot\omega\\\omega&\leftrightarrow(1,1)\cong1\cdot1+1\cdot\omega\\\bar{\omega}&\leftrightarrow(1,0)\cong1\cdot1+0\cdot\omega~.
  \end{align}
  In this way, the field elements form the Klein four group \(\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\) under addition.
  One can check that the trace operation, \(\text{tr}(\gamma) = \gamma + \gamma^2\), outputs either 0 or 1 for any element \(\gamma\in GF(4)\).

  Two \(q\)-ary codes are \textit{equivalent} if the codewords of one code can be mapped into those of the other under a combination of a coordinate permutation and a permutation of the elements of each coordinate. 
  The full group of such composite permutations is \(S_q \wr S_n\) \cite[Def. 1.8.8]{preset:HKSbasics}\cite{preset:HKSclass}.

# The field trace in this case is similar to taking the real part of a complex number, \(\text{tr}(\gamma) = \gamma + \gamma^2\) for any element \(\gamma\).

# The group of isometries of \(q\)-ary Hamming space is a combination of the monomial group, the Galois group of \(GF(q)\), and the group formed by the action of the space on itself (under addition) \cite{preset:HKSclass}.

protection: |
  The standard metric for \(q\)-ary codes is the Hamming metric, but other metrics also exist \cite{arxiv:2212.00431,preset:HKSmetrics}.
  A code detects errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, and corrects general errors on up to \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) coordinates.
  Often, the relative distance \(\delta=d/n\) is used to compare codes of different lengths.

  \subsection{Noise channels}

  Noise channels include the symmetric noise channel, asymmetric noise channels \cite{manual:{Varshamov, R. R. "Some features of linear codes that correct asymmetric errors." Soviet Physics Doklady. Vol. 9. 1965.},doi:10.1109/TIT.1973.1054954,doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(79)90329-2,manual:{Kløve, Torleiv. Error correcting codes for the asymmetric channel. Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Bergen, 1981.},doi:10.1142/6400}, and insertion/deletion noise.

  \subsection{Weight enumerator and four fundamental parameters}
  \begin{defterm}{Weight enumerator}
  \label{topic:weight-enumerator}
  Determining protection and bounds on code parameters can also be done using the code's \textit{weight enumerator} (cf. \hyperref[topic:quantum-weight-enumerator]{quantum weight enumerators}),
    \begin{align}
    \begin{split}
      A(x,y)&=\sum_{j=0}^{n}A_{j}x^{n-j}y^{j}\\
      A_{j}&=\text{number of wt-}j\text{ codewords}~.
    \end{split}
    \end{align}
  The weight enumerator and it's Fourier transform the \textit{dual weight enumerator} satisfy the \textit{MacWilliams identity} \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1963.tb04003.x,doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1972.tb01947.x}; see \cite[Ch. 5]{preset:MacSlo}.

  The distance of the code is the value of the first nonzero coefficient \(A_j\), while the \textit{dual distance} is the first nonzero coefficient of the dual weight enumerator.
  The \textit{number} of the code is the number of nonzero \(A_j\)'s, corresponding to the number of distinct nonzero distances between codewords.
  The \textit{external distance} is the number of nonzero coefficients of the dual weight enumerator.
  The distance, dual distance, number and external distance make up the \textit{four fundamental parameters} of a code \cite{doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(73)80007-5}\cite[Ch. 5]{preset:MacSlo}.

  Other types of weight enumerators includes the Hamming weight enumerator, Lee weight enumerator, joint weight enumerator, split weight enumerator, and biweight enumerator \cite{preset:MacSlo}.
  \end{defterm}

  \subsection{Bounds on code parameters}
  Bounds on the parameters of an \((n,K,d)_q\) code include the Hamming a.k.a. sphere-packing bound, Singleton bound, Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound, Griesmer bound, Plotkin bound, Johnson bound, and various linear programming (LP) bounds; see \cite{preset:HKSbasics}.
  A code whose parameters attain the Hamming bound (Singleton bound, Griesmer bound, Johnson bound, Delsarte LP bound) is called a perfect code (an MDS code, a Griesmer code, a nearly perfect code, an \hyperref[code:univ_opt_q-ary]{LP universally optimal code}).

  \begin{defterm}{Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound}
  \label{topic:gv-bound}
  The Gilbert-Varshamov \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1952.tb01393.x,manual:{R. R. Varshamov, Estimate of the number of signals in error correcting codes, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR Soviet Math. - Doklady 117 (1957), 739–741.}}, or Gilbert-Shannon-Varshamov, bound states that the maximum size \(K\) of a \(q\)-ary code with distance \(d\) satisfies
  \begin{align}
  K\sum_{j=0}^{d-1}{n \choose j}(q-1)^{j}\geq q^{n}~.
  \end{align}
  In other words, if the left-hand side of the above is less than or equal to the right-hand side, then a code with such parameters exists.
  The GV bound gives rise to the \textit{asymptotic GV bound} (i.e., GV bound in the \(n\to\infty\) limit), expressed in terms of the maximum achievable rate \(R\) and relative distance \(\delta\),
  \begin{align}
    R\geq 1-h_{q}(\delta)~,
  \end{align}
  where \(h_q\) is the \(q\)-ary entropy function,
  \begin{align}
    h_{q}(\delta)=-\delta\log_{q}\frac{\delta}{q-1}-(1-\delta)\log_{q}(1-\delta)~.
  \end{align}
  \end{defterm}



features:
  rate: 'The rate of a \(q\)-ary code is usually defined as \(R=\frac{1}{n}\log_q K\) dits per symbol. The maximum rate of a \(q\)-ary code with linear distance is lower bounded by the \hyperref[topic:gv-bound]{asymptotic GV bound} and upper bounded by the \(q\)-ary version of the MRRW LP bound \cite{doi:10.1016/0012-365X(90)90002-Y}.'
  decoders:
    - 'For small \(n\), decoding can be based on a lookup table. For infinite code families, the size of such a table scales exponentially with \(n\), so approximate decoding algorithms scaling polynomially with \(n\) have to be used. The decoder determining the most likely error given a noise channel is called the \textit{maximum-likelihood decoder}.'
    - 'Given a received string \(x\) and an error bound \(e\), a \textit{list decoder} returns a list of all codewords that are at most \(e\) from \(x\). The number of codewords in a neighborhood of \(x\) has to be polynomial in \(n\) in order for this decoder to run in time polynomial in \(n\).'
