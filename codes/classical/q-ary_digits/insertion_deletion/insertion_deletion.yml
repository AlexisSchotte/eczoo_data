name: 'Editing code'
introduced: '\cite{manual:{Levenshtein, Vladimir I. "Binary codes capable of correcting deletions, insertions, and reversals." Soviet physics doklady. Vol. 10. No. 8. 1966.}}'

alternative_names:
  - 'Insertion and deletion code'

description: |
    A code designed to protect against insertions, where a new symbol is added somewhere within the string, and deletions, where a symbol at an unknown location is erased.
# Since deletions come at unknown locations, they are more difficult to deal with than erasures.

protection: |
    The metric measuring distance of an error word to the nearest codeword is the \textit{Levenshtein's deletion distance}: given vectors \(u,v\), this distance is one-half the smallest number of deletions and insertions needed to change \(u\) to \(v\).
    A code \(C\) corrects \(e\) deletions if all codewords are separated by at least \(e+1\) in the deletion distance \cite{arxiv:math/0207197}.
    Similar distances, collectively called \textit{editing distances}, can be defined for insertions and related operations \cite[Sec. 22.7]{preset:HKSmetrics}.


# features:
#   rate: 'For binary codes, the optimal achievable rate to protect against a \(\delta\) fraction of insertions and deletions is \(1- O(\delta \log\frac{1}{\delta})\).'
# In the large alphabet setting, there exists a code which corrects a \(\delta\) fraction of insertions and deletions and has a rate of \((1-\Omega)^5\).'
