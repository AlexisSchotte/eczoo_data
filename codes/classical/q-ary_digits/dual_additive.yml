code_id: dual_additive

name: 'Dual additive code'

description: |
  For any  \(q\)-ary additive code \(C\), the dual additive code is
  \begin{align}
  C^\perp = \{ y\in GF(q)^{\times n} ~|~ x \star y=0 \forall x\in C\},
  \end{align}
  where the trace inner product is \(x\star y = \sum_{i=1}^n \text{tr}(x_i y_i)\) for coordinates \(x_i,y_i\), and the trace maps elements of the field \(GF(q)\) with \(q=p^m\) to elements of \(GF(p)\) as
  \begin{align}
    \text{tr}(\gamma)=\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\gamma^{p^{k}}~.
  \end{align}

  A code that contains its dual, \(C^\perp \subseteq C\), is called \textit{self-orthogonal additive}, \textit{self-orthogonal additive}, or \textit{dual-containing additive}. A code that is equal to its dual, \(C^\perp = C\), is called \textit{self-dual additive}.

  For cases when \(q\) is a square, an alternative definition of dual substitutes the trace inner product for the \textit{trace-Hermitian inner product}, \(x\star y \to \sum_{i=1}^n \text{tr}(x_i y^{\sqrt{q}}_i)\). A further extension, relevant to \hyperref[code:stabilizer_over_gfqsq]{certain stabilizer codes} and reducing to the trace-Hermitian case for \(q=4\), is the \textit{trace-alternating inner product}, \begin{align}
    x\star y \to \sum_{i=1}^{n}\text{tr}\left(\frac{x_{i}y_{i}^{\sqrt{q}}-x_{i}^{\sqrt{q}}y_{i}}{\alpha-\alpha^{q}}\right)~,
  \end{align}
  where \(\{1,\alpha\}\) is a basis of \(GF(q)\) over \(GF(\sqrt{q})\). Self-dual additive codes with respect to the trace-Hermitian (trace-alternating) inner product are called \textit{trace Hermitian (trace-alternating) self-dual additive}.

      detail: 'The difference between the definitions of dual linear and dual additive codes is in the trace used in the inner product. Self-dual linear codes are also self-dual additive codes.'
