code_id: dual_additive

name: 'Dual additive code'

description: |
  For any  \([n,k]_q\) additive code \(C\), the dual additive code is
  \begin{align}
  C^\perp = \{ y\in GF(q)^{\times n} ~|~ x \star y=0 \forall x\in C\},
  \end{align}
  where the trace inner product is \(x\star y = \sum_{i=1}^n \text{tr}(x_i y_i)\) for coordinates \(x_i,y_i\), and the trace maps elements of the field to elements of \(GF(p)\) as
  \begin{align}
    \text{tr}(\gamma)=\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\gamma^{p^{k}}~.
  \end{align}

  A code that contains its dual, \(C^\perp \subseteq C\), is called \textit{weakly self-dual additive} or \textit{self-orthogonal additive}. A code that is equal to its dual, \(C^\perp = C\), is called \textit{self-dual additive}.

protection: 'The dual of an \([n,k,d] \) code
  is an \([n,n-k,d'']\) code, where \(d''\) is not always related to \(d\). The generator matrix of \(C^\perp\) is the parity check matrix of \(C\), and visa versa.'

      detail: 'The difference between the definitions of dual linear and dual additive codes is in the inner product. Self-dual linear codes are also self-dual additive codes.'
