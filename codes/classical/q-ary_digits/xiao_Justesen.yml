description: 'Given m, Justesen_code is a binary code over GF(2^m), with length n=2mN, dimension k=mK, where (N=2^m-1,K) is the reed-solomon outer code'
             'The code can be considered as concatenation of a Reed-Solomon outer code with N distinct inner codes'

features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

notes: 'The code can be improved and extend the range of R from 0 to 1 by puncturiing the code (by erasing s digits from each inner code), resulting in a code of length n=(2m-s)N, rate R=mk/(2m-s)N. The lower bound of the distance of the punctured code'
       'approaches d=(1-R/r)H^{-1}(1-R) as m goes to infinity, where r is the solution to R=r^2/(1+log(1-H^{-1}(1-r))), and H being the binary entropy function.'
