description: 'Let G(z) be a Goppa polynomial with coefficients from GF\(q^m\) for some fixed integer m. Let L be a finite subset of the extension field GF(q^m) where q is prime, meaning L  = \{\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n\} is a subset of GF\(q^m\) such that \alpha_i \neq 0 for all \alpha_i \in L. A Goppa code \Gamma\(L,G\) is an [n,k,d] linear code consisting of all vectors a = \(a_1, \cdots, a_n\) 
	such that\( R_a(z) =0 mod G(z) \) where \( R_a(z) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{a_i}{z - \alpha_i} \).'


protection: 'If the deg G(z) = 2t, then there exists a t-correcting algebraic decoding algorithm for \( \Gamma(L,G) \).'
