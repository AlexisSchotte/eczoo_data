description: 'Let \( G(z) \)  be a polynomial describing a projective plane curve with coefficients from \( GF(q^m) \)  for some fixed integer m. Let \( L \) be a finite subset of the extension field \( GF(q^m) \)  where q is prime, meaning \( L  = \{\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n\} \) is a subset of nonzero elements of GF\(q^m\). A Goppa code \( \Gamma(L,G) \) is an [n,k,d] linear code consisting of all vectors a = \(a_1, \cdots, a_n\) 
	such that\( R_a(z) =0 mod G(z) \) where \( R_a(z) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{a_i}{z - \alpha_i} \).'


protection:  'The length \( n = |L| \) , the dimension \( k \geq n-mr \) where \( r = deg G(z) \), and the minimum distance \( d \geq r +1 \). ' 

features: 
  rate: 
    - 'There exist Goppa codes defined over larger alphabets that meet the Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound.'
  
  decoders: 
    - 'Algebraic decoding algorithms defined in \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1975.1055350}'
    - 'If the \( deg G(z) = 2t \) , then there exists a t-correcting algebraic decoding algorithm for \( \Gamma(L,G) \).'

realizations: 
  - 'The binary version \( (q=2) \) is commonly used in post-quantum cryptosystems such as the McElise cryptosystem.'
   

notes:
  - 'GAP function GoppaCode(G,L) takes in a polynomial G that satisfies the necessary conditions for a Goppa code and a list L that contains elements in GF(q) that are not roots of the polynomial G. It  returns a Goppa code C. More details can be found at 
	\url{https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/guava/doc/chap5.html#X7EE808BB7D1E487A}.'


relations:
  parents: 
    - code_id: alternant
      detail: 'alternant codes are the smallest code family that includes Goppa codes that are defined over GF(q^m).'
    - code_id: q-ary_linear
      detail: ''

  cousins:
    - code_id: bch
      detail: 'Another special case of alternant codes. However, unlike certain forms of Goppa codes, they do not meet the GV bound.'
