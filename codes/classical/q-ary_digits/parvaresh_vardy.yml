physical: q-ary_digits
logical: q-ary_digits

name: 'Parvaresh-Vardy (PV) code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/SFCS.2005.29}'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{correlated RS code}. An IRS code with additional algebraic relations (a.k.a. correlations) imposed between the codeword polynomials \(\{f^{(j)}\}_{j=1}^{t}\). These relations yielded a list decoder that achieves list-decoding capacity.

features:
  decoders:
  - 'PV codes can be list-decoded up to \(1-(t k/n)^{1/(t+1)}\) fraction of errors. This result improves over the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm for ordinary \hyperref[code:reed_solomon]{RS} codes, which list-decodes up to \(1-\sqrt{k/n}\) fraction of errors.'

relations:
  parents:
    - code_id: interleaved_reed_solomon
  cousins:
    - code_id: folded_reed_solomon
      detail: 'The specific relations imposed on the polynomials of PV codes allow for them to be expressed in a similar way as FRS codes, but with more redundancy. Folded RS codes can be list-decoded up to a higher fraction of errors.'
