  Frameproof codes are those that prevent a group of users from being able to collude to frame another user outside of the group of creating an unauthorized copy of data. Even further, the group of users cannot frame a separate user even if they know the unique codeword of the separate user \cite{doi:10.1007/3-540-44750-4_36}.
  
  Let us start with some definitions to then define what a c-frameproof code is. A set \(\Gamma = \{w^{\(1\)}, \dots, w^{\(n\)}\} \subseteq \{0,1\}^{l\}\) is an \(l,n\)-code. Each codeword w^{\(i\)} correlates to a user u_i.
  Let C be a group of users. A bit in position i is undetectable for the group C when the words assigned to the users in the group match at the the same position i.
  The feasible set of the group C, denoted F\(C;\Gamma\) or F\(C\), for some user u in C contains all of the codewords that match the groups set of undetectable bits. Finally, if every subset S \subset \Gamma of size at most c satisfies F\(S\)\cap\Gamma = S, then \Gamma is a c-frameproof code \cite{doi:10.1007/3-540-44750-4_36}.'

protection: 'Frameproof codes help to provide software protection from the illegal distribution and copying of computer software and copyrighted materials. These codes help protect products of distributors as well as other naive users from being framed of illegal activity \cite{doi:10.1007/3-540-44750-4_36}.'

features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

  rate: 'The specific type of frameproof error correcting codes spoken in \cite{doi:10.1007/3-540-44750-4_36} have a large minimal distance and a low rate. Specifically, for any positive integers n and c, if l = 16c^{2}logn then there exists a c-frameproof \(l,n\)-code which has rate n/l \cite{doi:10.1007/3-540-44750-4_36}.'
