name: 'Zetterberg code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1962.1057682}'


description: 'The Zetterberg code \(C_s\) is a binary cyclic code of length \(n = 2^{2s}+1\) generated by the
minimal polynomial \(g_s(x)\) of \(\alpha\) over GF(2), where \(\alpha\) is a primitive \(n^{th}\) root of unity in the field \(GF(2^{4s})\). They are quasi-perfect codes and is one of the best known families of double-error correcting binary linear codes'

protection: 'Correct all weight-2 errors with a small number of exceptions. By making some alterations to the code, one can form codes that correct all weight-2 errors.'


features:


  rate: 'The rate is given by \(1-\frac{4s}{n}\), which is asymptotically good, but the minimum distance is a constant of either 5 or 6.'
  
  decoders:
    - 'Decoding through linear-feedback shift registers.'
    - 'Kallquist first described an algebraic decoding theorem. A faster version was later provided in \cite{doi:10.1109/18.149509} and further modified in \cite{doi:10.1109/LCOMM.2010.07.100784} which can detect up to weight error of 3.'

realizations:
  - 'Code used to provide better protection of data transmission with its double error correcting capacity.'

      detail: 'Perfect codes have the property of quasi-perfect codes which says that Hamming balls of radius \(t\) are disjoint and they also have the additional property that these Hamming balls exactly fill the Hamming space defined over length n of the codes.'
