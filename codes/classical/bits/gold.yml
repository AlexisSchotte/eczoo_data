description: 'A \([2^r -1, 2r ]\) is a cyclic linear code characterized by the generator polynomial of degree r of a preferred-pair of m-sequences.'

features:
  
  encoders:
    - 'Codewords of Gold codes are generated using m-sequences x and y, which are codewords of simplex codes with check polynomials of degree r. The information bits are initialized in the shift registers of the the two m-sequences x and y.'

  decoders:
    - 'General decoding is done by building a sparse parity check matrix, followed by applying an iterative message passing alogirithm. \cite{doi:10.1007/s11265-006-7278-y}, \cite{doi:10.1109/18.910572}.'

realizations:
  - 'Used in for synchronization purposes in telecommunication and satelite navigation.'
