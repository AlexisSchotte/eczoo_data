description: |-
  A nonlinear single-asymmetric-error code that generalize VT codes and that is constructed from an Abelian group.

  A CR code for group \(G\) and fixed group element \(g\) consists of all binary strings \(c=c_1c_2\cdotsc_n\) that satisfy \(\sum_i^n c_i g_i = g\) for some elements \(g_i\) \cite[Def. 1.3]{arxiv:1310.7536}.
  Here, addition is the group operation, the multiplication \(1 g_i = g_i\), and \(0 g_i = 0_G\) where \(0_G\) is the identity element. 

  CR codes can be generalized to the \(q\)-ary case and also to codes correcting more than one asymmetric error \cite{manual:{Kløve, Torleiv. Error correcting codes for the asymmetric channel. Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Bergen, 1981.}}.

protection: |
  Protect against single errors induced by the asymmetric noise channel.
  Codes for some groups, and in particular, the VT codes, also protect against single deletions and insertions \cite{doi:10.1109/ITW.2009.5351208}.

features:
  rate: |
    CR codes for particular groups have higher rates than single-error-correcting codes under the binary asymmetric channel for all lengths except \(n = 2^r - 1\), in which case CR codes reduce to Hamming codes \cite{manual:{Kløve, Torleiv. Error correcting codes for the asymmetric channel. Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Bergen, 1981.}}; see Ref. \cite{arxiv:1310.7536}.
    Size analysis is presented in Refs. \cite{doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(80)90082-0,doi:10.1109/18.651063}.'
