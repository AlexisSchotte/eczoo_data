code_id: convolutional
physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'Convolutional'

introduced: '\cite{manual:Peter Elias. Coding for noisy channels. IRE Convention Records, 3(4):37–46, 1955.}'

description: 'Convolutional codes are classical codes that are formed using generator polynomials over the finite field with two elements. The encoder slides across contiguous subsets of the input bit-string (like a convolutional neural network) evaluating the polynomials on that window to obtain a number of parity bits. These parity bits are the encoded information. There are many ways to formulate these codes'

protection: 'Bit flip errors'

features:

  rate: 'Depends on the polynomials used. Using puncturing \cite{doi:10.12928/telkomnika.v10i4.171} removal the rate for the code can be increased from 1/n to m/n for some m, n.'

  encoders: 
    - 'Evaluation on the generator polynomials. Can be implemented with a small number of XOR gates'

  decoders:
    - 'Decoders based on the Viterbi algorithm (trellis decoding) were developed first, which result in the most-likely codeword for the encoded bits \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1967.1054010}. Following, other trellis decoders such as the BCJR decoding algorithm \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1974.1055186} were developed later.'

realizations:
  - 'A type of convolutional code used in Real-time Applcation networks \cite{manual:Salehe Mrutu, Anael Sam, Nerey Myungi. Forward Error Correction Convolutional Codes for RTAs’ Networks: An Overview. 2014.}'
  - 'Mobile and radio communications (3G networks) use convolutional codes concatenated with Reed-Solomon codes to obtain suitable performance \cite{Halonen, Timo, Javier Romero, and Juan Melero, eds. GSM, GPRS and EDGE performance: evolution towards 3G/UMTS. 2004.}'
  - 'A convolutional code with rate 1/2 was used for deep-space and satellite communication \cite{manual:Butman, Deutsch, and Miller. Performance of concatenated codes for deep space missions. 1981.}'

notes:
  - 'Often used in concatenation with Reed-Soloman codes'
