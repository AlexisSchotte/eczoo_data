name: 'Binary Golay code'
introduced: '\cite{Golay, M. J. E. "Notes on Digital Coding." Proc. IRE 37, 657, 1949.}'

# Anything applicable to a larger parent set of codes (see below) should go in
# that entry instead of here.
description: 'The binary Golay code is a [23, 12, 7] binary linear code. Adding a parity bit results in the [24, 12, 8] extended binary Golay code. The binary Golay code is a perfect code, i.e. it saturates the Hamming bound, and as such is also known as the perfect binary Golay code. The codespace is a 12-dimensional linear subspace of \(\mathbb{F}_2^23\) (or \(\mathbb{F}_2^24\)).'

features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.
