description: |
  Also known as a \textit{Walsh code} or \textit{Walsh-Hadamard code}. An \([2^m,m,2^{m-1}]\) balanced binary code dual to an extended Hamming Code.

  The \([2^m,m+1,2^{m-1}]\) \text{augmented Hadamard code} can be constructed by adding a 0 bit. Its codewords are the rows of the \(2^m\)-dimensional Hadamard matrix \(H\) and its negation \(-H\) with the mapping \(+1\to 0\) and \(-1\to 1\).

      detail: 'The Hadamard code is the first code to be identified as locally testable \cite{doi:10.1016/0022-0000(93)90044-W}.'
    - code_id: long
      detail: 'The Hadamard code is a subcode of the long code and can be obtained by restricting the long-code construction to only linear functions.'
    - code_id: balanced
      detail: 'Each Hadamard codeword has length \(2^m\) and Hamming weight of \(2^{m-1}\), making this code balanced.'

      detail: 'The Hadamard code is the dual of the extended Hamming Code. Conversely, the shortened Hadamard code is the dual of the Hamming Code.'
