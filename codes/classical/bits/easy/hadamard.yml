name: 'Hadamard code'

description: 'Also known as \textit{Walsh code} or \textit{Walsh-Hadamard code}. An \([2^k,k,2^{k-1}]\) balanced binary code dual to an extended Hamming Code.'

  parents:
    - code_id: binary_linear
    - code_id: balanced
      detail: 'Each Hadamard codeword has length \(2^m\) and Hamming weight of \(2^{m-1}\), making this code balanced.'
    - code_id: ltc
      detail: 'The Hadamard code is the first code to be identified as locally testable \cite{doi:10.1016/0022-0000(93)90044-W}.'
    - code_id: long
      detail: 'The Hadamard code is a subcode of the long code and can be obtained by restricting the long-code construction to only linear functions.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: dual
      detail: 'The Hadamard code is the dual of the extended Hamming Code.'
    - code_id: hamming
      detail: 'The Hadamard code is the dual of the extended Hamming Code. Conversely, the shortened Hadamard code is the dual of the Hamming Code.'
    - code_id: reed_muller
      detail: 'For any Hamming code \([2^m,2^m-m-1,3]\), the dual Hadamard code, when augmented with a bit that is always 0, gives the RM\((1,m)\) code. In general, RM\((1,m)\) is related to the duals of the Hamming code, and when RM\((1,m)\) is self-dual, it is directly related to the Hamming code.'
