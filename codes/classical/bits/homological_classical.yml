name: 'Graph Homology code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0605094}'

description: 'Given a connected simplicial (no self loops or muliedges) graph \(G = (V, E)\), which is not a tree, with incidence matrix \(\Gamma\) we can construct a code by choosing a parity check matrix which consists of all the linearly independent rows of \(\Gamma\). This is a \([n,k,d]\) code with \(n = |E|\), \(k = 1 - \mathcal{X}(G) = 1-|V|+|E|\), where \( \mathcal{X}(G)\) is the euler characteristic of the graph. The code distance is equal to the shortest size of a cycle, guaranteed to exist since \(G\) is not a tree.'

notes:
  - 'This class of codes is referred to as "homological" since its properties are derived from the size two chain complex associated with the graph.'

      detail: 'CSS codes can also be constructed using homology techniques but for manifolds of dimension two or greater.'
