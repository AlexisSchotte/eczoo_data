             'A random binary linear code is generated from a random chosen K generators of length N where each bit of the generators is randomly chosen between 0 and 1 with equal probability.'

features: 'Given N and the rate R, the minimum distance of a typical random code (TRC) is given by the Gilbertâ€“Varshamov (GV) bound d=N\delta_{GV}(2R).'
          'Whereas for a typical random linear code (TLC), the minimum distane is given by d=N\delta_{GV}(R).'


  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.
