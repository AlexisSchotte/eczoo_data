name: 'Fibonacci code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2021.3068359}'

description: |
  The code is defined on a \(L\times L/2\) lattice with one bit on each site, where \(L=2^N\) for an integer \(N\geq 2\). The codewords are defined to satisfy the condition that, for each lattice site \((x,y)\), the bits on \((x,y)\), \((x+1,y)\), \((x-1,y)\) and \((x,y+1)\) (where the lattice is taken to be periodic in both directions) contain an even numbers of \(1\)'s.
  The codewords can be generated using a one-dimensional cellular automaton of length \(L\) (periodic). The \(2^L\) possible initial conditions correspond to The \(2^L\) cordwords. The \(i\)th generation corresponding to the \(i\)th generation. The update rule is that the state of each cell is the xor sum of that cell and its two neighbors in the previous generation.
  The code distance is more than \(L\), but the exact value is unknown.

  decoders:
    - 'An efficient algorithm base on minimum-weight perfect matching \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2021.3068359}, which can correct high-weight errors that span the lattice, with failure rate decaying super-exponentially with \(L\).'
