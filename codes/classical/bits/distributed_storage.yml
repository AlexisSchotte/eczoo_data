name: 'Distributed-storage code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:1408.4862}'

description: 'A storage code is a way of representing information in a distributed storage system wherein the contents of the file is spread across multiple nodes. In the event of node failure the contents of the node can be recovered from a subset of other nodes in the system, called the helper nodes.'

protection: 'Protects a distributed storage system against the failure of a single node or multiple nodes.'

notes:
  - 'The size of the code depends on the underlying structure of the distributed storage system.'

      detail: 'An \((n,k)\)optimal linear erasure codes have the property that any \(k\) out of the \(n\) codeword symbols are sufficient to recover the original message.'

      detail: 'Reed-Solomon codes are MDS codes and they are used very often to protect the distributed systems.'
