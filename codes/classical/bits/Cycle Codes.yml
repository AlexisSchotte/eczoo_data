name: 'cycle code of graphs'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.1968.1054190}'

description: 'The cycle code is nothing but an $F_2$ linear space spanned by the incidence vectors of the cycles in the set of edges.'

protection: 'The cycle code corrects up to $\frac{d-1}{2}$ Hamming errors, where $d$ is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph.Let $G$ be a finite, undirected, connected graph without loops and multiple edges.The graph $G$ has $r$ vertices and $n$ edges. Its parity check matrix $H$ is defined as follows.$H$ is an $r \times n$ matrix whose rows are indexed by the vertices of $G$ and whose columns are indexed by the edges of $G$, and such that $H_{ij}=1$ if vertex $i$ belongs to the edge $j$ and $H_{ij}=0$ otherwise. The rate is $k=n-r+1$.\cite{doi:10.1007/978-3-642-01877-0_21}'

notes:
  - 'The cycle codes can be regarded as simplest LDPC codes.\cite{doi:10.1007/978-3-642-01877-0_21}.'

    - code_id: surface
      detail: 'The surface codes are a family of quantum error correcting codes defined on a 2D lattice of qubits. Each code within this family has stabilizers that are defined equivalently in the bulk, but differ from one another in their boundary conditions.The constructions are chain-complex based and it is a quantum LDPC codes.'
   # - code_id: toric 
    #  detail: 'The toric code is defined on a two-dimensional lattice, usually chosen to be the square lattice, with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ degree of freedom located on each edge. They are chosen to be periodic.The constructions are chain-complex based and it is a quantum LDPC codes.'
