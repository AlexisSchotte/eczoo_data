description: |
  A binary linear code \(C\) of length \(n\) that is \((u,R)\)-locally testable for some query complexity \(u\) and soundness \(R\). The idea behind LTCs is to be able to reliably test whether a given bit-string \(x\) is in the code by only sampling subsets of \(u\) bits. To have something to check against, we first have to define a collection of length-\(w\) subsets \(S\) of bit locations that are called \textit{allowed local views}. Note that linearity is not required for binary LTCs, but all child entries happen to be binary linear.

  A code is LTC if the following two conditions are satisfied \cite[Thm. 1.1]{arxiv:2111.04808}. First, if \(x\) is a codeword, then all of its restrictions \(x|_S\) to the subsets \(S\) are allowed local views,
  \begin{align}
    x\in C \Rightarrow x|_S \in \{\text{allowed local views}\}~.
  \end{align}
  This guarantees that codewords can indeed be determined from this limited sampling procedure.

  Second, the probability that a given restriction is not an allowed local view is lower-bounded by the relative distance to the code,
  \begin{align}
    \text{Pr}_S (x|_S\text{ not allowed local view}) \geq R \frac{D(x,C)}{n}~,
  \end{align}
  where \(D(x,C)\) is the Hamming distance between \(x\) and the closest codeword to \(x\). This condition ensures that strings \(x\) can be deemed to be not in the codespace with high probability, i.e., with probability increasing as \(x\) gets farther from the code.
