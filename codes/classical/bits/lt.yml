description: 'Luby Transform codes are erasure codes based on fountain codes. They improve on random linear fountain codes by having a much more efficient encoding and decoding algorithm.'

protection: 'Designed to protect agains erasure errors. '

# This field starts a list of specific labeled subfields; do not leave it
# empty. If empty, comment out. Also, indentations are important!
features:

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.
  #
  # Any fields below should be omitted if they do not apply.

  rate: 'Being fountain codes, LT codes do not have a fixed rate.'
  
  # This field that starts a list of strings, indexed by a dash; do not leave it
  # empty. If empty, comment out.
  encoders:
    - 'Randomly choose a degree \(d_n\) from a degree distribution depending on total size \(K\). Randomly choose \(d_n\) distinct source packets and let the packet to be transmitted \(\hat{p}_n\) be the bitwise sum of the chosen input packets.'
    - 'Forms a graph connecting encoded packets to source packets.'
