code_id: insertion-deletion
physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'Insertion and deletion code'
introduced: '\url{https://nymity.ch/sybilhunting/pdf/Levenshtein1966a.pdf}'

description: 'The codes capable of correcting insertions, where a new symbol is added somewhere within the string, and deletions, that is, a symbol of a the string being removed without replacement.In general insertions and deletions don't reveal the locations and are much more difficult to deal with compared with erasures.'

protection: 'Protects against deletions and insertions'

features:

 rate: 'For binary codes, the optimal achievable rate to protect against a  $\delta$ fraction of insertions and deletions is $1- \mathcal{O}(\delta log\frac{1}{\delta}$.For the large alphabet setting, there exists a code which corrects $\delta$ fraction of insertions and deletions and has the rate of $(1-\Omega)^5$.'
