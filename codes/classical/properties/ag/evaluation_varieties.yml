code_id: evaluation_varieties

name: 'Evaluation code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1007/BF02249124,preset:HPAlgCodes}'

description: |
  Code whose codewords are evaluations of functions at certain fixed points. Code properties can be inferred from the structure of the underlying geometric object containing the points, often using results from algebraic geometry.

  Let \(\cal{X}\) be a geometric object that contains a subset \({\cal P} = \left( P_1,P_2,\cdots,P_n \right) \) consisting of \(n\) points \(P_j\). Let \(L\) be a vector space over \(GF(q)\) of functions \(f\) that take values in \(GF(q)\). Each \(f\in L\) yields a codeword of an evaluation code \(C_L({\cal X},{\cal P})\) of the form
  \begin{align}
    \left( f(P_1), f(P_2), \cdots, f(P_n) \right) \quad\quad\forall f\in L~.
  \end{align}
  This is a linear binary or \(q\)-ary code since the functions \(f\) take values in \(GF(q)\) and form a vector space.

  Examples of geometric objects \(\cal X\) include affine or projective spaces over \(GF(q)\) as well as subsets of those spaces determined by some constraints. Prominent subsets are \textit{algebraic varieties}, i.e., sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations in either affine or projective space. The functions \(f\) are typically polynomials or rational functions.

protection: 'Properties of \(\cal X\) can be used to bound the code dimension \(k\) and distance \(d\). The order or Feng-Rao bound gives a lower bound on the distance of evaluation codes \cite{doi:10.1142/9789812794017_0004,doi:10.1109/18.335973,doi:10.1109/18.179340,doi:10.1023/A:1008274212057,preset:HPAlgCodes} (see Ref. \cite{preset:HPAlgCodes}, Ch. 4).'

#      detail: 'Evaluation codes are defined for points that lie in an algebraic variety. There is a more general definition in terms of morphisms of algebras over \(GF(q)\) (\cite{preset:HPAlgCodes}, Def. 4.1), in which case any linear code can be formulated as an evaluation code \cite{}.'
#  Evaluation codes can also be defined more abstractly in terms of morphisms of algebras over \(GF(q)\) (\cite{preset:HPAlgCodes}, Def. 4.1).
