code_id: dual

name: 'Dual linear code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1201/9781315147901}'

description: |
  For any  \([n,k]\) binary or \(q\)-ary linear code \(C\), the dual (or orthogonal) code,
  \begin{align}
  C^\perp = \{ y\in GF(q)^{\times n} ~|~ x\cdot y=0 \forall x\in C\},
  \end{align}
  where the \textit{ordinary}, \textit{standard}, or \textit{Euclidean} inner product is \(x\cdot y = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i\) for coordinates \(x_i,y_i\).

  A code that is contained in its dual, \(C \subseteq C^\perp\), is called \textit{self-orthogonal}, \textit{weakly self-dual}, or \textit{dual-containing}. A code that is equal to its dual, \(C^\perp = C\), is called \textit{self-dual}. The dual of a dual code is the original code.

  For cases when \(q\) is a square, an alternative definition of dual substitutes the Euclidean inner product for the \textit{Hermitian inner product}, \(x\cdot y \to \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y^{\sqrt{q}}_i\). More general inner products can also be considered \cite{doi:10.1007/s10623-016-0282-8}. Self-dual codes with respect to the Hermitian inner product are called \textit{Hermitian self-dual}.

  The dual code \(C^\perp\) is the row space of the parity check matrix of \(C\). The dual code is the kernel of the encoding map for \(C\), and \(\dim C^\perp = n-k\).

protection: 'The dual of an \([n,k,d] \) code
  is an \([n,n-k,d'']\) code, where \(d''\) is not always related to \(d\). The generator matrix of \(C^\perp\) is the parity check matrix of \(C\), and visa versa.'
