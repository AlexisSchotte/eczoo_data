description: |
  An \((n,K,2t+1)_q\) binary or \(q\)-ary code is perfect if parameters \(n\), \(K\), \(t\), and \(q\) are such that the Hamming (a.k.a. sphere-packing) bound
  \begin{align}
  \sum_{j=0}^{t}(q-1)^{j}{n \choose j}\leq q^{n}/K
  \end{align}
  becomes an equality. For example, for a binary \(q=2\) code with one logical bit (\(K=2\)) and \(t=1\), the bound becomes \(n+1 \leq 2^{n-1}\).

  Any perfect linear code is either a repetition code, a Hamming code, or a binary or ternary Golay code \cite{doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(77)90519-8}. If \(q\) is a prime power, any distance-three code is either a Hamming code or a nonlinear code with the same parameters; see Ref. \cite{doi:10.1201/9781315147901}, pg. 100, for more details.

  Perfect codes are those for which balls of Hamming radius \(t\) exactly fill the space of all \(n\) \(q\)-ary strings. \textit{Quasi-perfect codes} are those for which balls of Hamming radius \(t\) are disjoint, while balls of radius \(t+1\) cover the space with possible overlaps. In other words, any \(q\)-ary string is at most \(t+1\) bit flips away from a codeword of a quasi-perfect code.

  For binary codes with \(K=2^k\), one can work out an asymptotic Hamming bound in the large-\(n,k,t\) limit,
  \begin{align}
  \frac{k}{n}\leq 1-h(t/n),
  \end{align}
  where \(h\) is the binary entropy function.

  A code with distance \(d=2t\) is \textit{nearly perfect} if any \(q\)-ary string is at most \(t\) bit flips away from a codeword \cite{doi:10.1016/0012-365X(72)90025-8,manual:{Terr, David. "Nearly Perfect Code." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W. Weisstein. https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NearlyPerfectCode.html}} (see also Ref. \cite{preset:MacSlo}, Ch. 17). Any perfect code can be extended to a nearly perfect code. All nearly perfect codes are quasi-perfect.
