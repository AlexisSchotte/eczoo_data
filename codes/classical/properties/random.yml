code_id: random

name: 'Random code'
#introduced: ''

description: 'Code whose construction is non-deterministic in some way, i.e., codes that utilize an elements of randomness somewhere in their construction. Members of this class range from fully non-deterministic codes, to codes whose multi-step construction is deterministic with the exception of a single step.
              Typically, random codes are selected with uniform distribution from a ensemble of codes. Examples are:
              A random binary code: a set of 2^{K}=2^{NR} codewords with length N. Each bit in the codeword is randomly chosen between 0 and 1 with equal probability.
              A random binary linear code: is generated from a random chosen K generators of length N where each bit of the generators is randomly chosen between 0 and 1 with equal probability.
              Equivalently, A random binary linear code is defined by a randomly generated K by N generator matrix where each entry is randomly chosen between 0 and 1 with equal probability.'

protection: 'The code can protect against random errors, e.g. from Binary Symmetry Channel (BSC), discrete memoryless channel.'

features: 'Given N and the rate R, the minimum distance of a typical random code (TRC) is given by the Gilbertâ€“Varshamov (GV) bound d=N\delta_{GV}(2R).
           Whereas for a typical random linear code (TLC), the minimum distane is given by d=N\delta_{GV}(R).'

notes:
    - 'Code features refer to the asymptotic limit, i.e. The code approach the minimum distance with probability 1 as N goes to infiity.'
