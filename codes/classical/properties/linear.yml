code_id: linear

name: 'Linear code'

description: |
  A code whose set of codewords is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of its alphabet, which can be either a field or a ring. In other words, for any codewords \(x,y\), \(\alpha x+ \beta y\) is also a codeword for any alphabet elements \(\alpha,\beta\). This extra structure yields much information about their properties, making them a large and well-studied subset of codes.

  parents:
    - code_id: group_orbit
      detail: 'Since codewords of a linear code form an abelian group under addition, any codeword \(c\) can be obtained from any other codeword via addition of a codeword. This means that the set of codewords can be thought of as an orbit of a particular codeword under the group; e.g., see \cite[Thm. 8.4.2]{preset:EricZin} for the binary case.
      However, group orbit codes do not have to be linear; see \cite[Remark 8.4.3]{preset:EricZin}.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: stabilizer
      detail: 'Linear (stabilizer) codes form a large and well-studied subset of all classical (quantum) codes because features such as decoding and level of protection are typically easier to determine than those of nonlinear (non-stabilizer) codes.'
