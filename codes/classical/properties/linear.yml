code_id: linear

name: 'Linear code'

description: |
  A code whose set of codewords is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of its alphabet, which can be either a field or a ring. In other words, for any codewords \(x,y\), \(\alpha x+ \beta y\) is also a codeword for any alphabet elements \(\alpha,\beta\). This extra structure yields much information about their properties, making them a large and well-studied subset of codes.

      detail: 'Linear (stabilizer) codes form a large and well-studied subset of all classical (quantum) codes because features such as decoding and level of protection are typically easier to determine than those of nonlinear (non-stabilizer) codes.'
