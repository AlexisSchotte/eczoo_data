code_id: constant_weight

name: 'Constant-weight code'
#introduced: ''

description: |
  Also known as an \textit{\(m\)-in-\(n\)} or \({n \choose m}\) code. A linear binary or \(q\)-ary code whose codewords all have the same Hamming weight. Such codes provide slightly extra redundancy for storage of small-scale information such as ZIP codes or decimal digits.

  For example, the two-in-five code has a size of 10, thereby providing an encoding for the decimal digits 0 through 9. Such a code detects some single bit-flips as well as unidirectional errors using the fact that each codeword is weight-two. The code fails for any sequence of flips that maintains the constant weight.
