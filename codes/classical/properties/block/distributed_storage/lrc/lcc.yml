code_id: lcc

name: 'Locally correctable code (LCC)'
short_name: 'LCC'
# introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1145/335305.335315}'

# LDCs are similar in nature to LRC, but work in another regime. Namely, given a heavily corrupted codeword within the decoding radius, you need to recover any given bit of the message using a small number of queries

#   Block code for which one can efficiently correct a given string.
# Efficiency of the correction is quantified by the code's \textit{query complexity} \(u\), and correction is performed by sampling subsets of \(u\) bits.
# Local decodability may only be possible up to some tolerated corruption rate \(\delta\).


description: |
	Recall that a block code encodes a length-\(k\) message into a length-\(n\) codeword, which is then sent through a noise channel to yield an error word.
  Informally, an LCC is a block code for which one can recover any coordinate of a codeword from at most \(r\) coordinates of the error word (assuming the error word is within the decoding radius).

  LDCs have applications in computational complexity theory and cryptography \cite[Sec. 17.4]{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511804090}\cite{doi:10.1561/0400000030,doi:10.1145/301250.301397,doi:10.1145/2993749.2993761}.

  Modified versions of local decodability include \textit{relaxed local decodability} \cite{doi:10.1145/1007352.1007361}.

      detail: 'LRCs (LCCs) allow one to recover any coordinate of a codeword from at most \(r\) coordinates of a codeword (an error word within the decoding radius).
      Since a codeword is a trivial error word, any LCC is also an LRC.'

      More generally, any family of LCCs can be converted to a family of LDCs whose rate differs by a constant \cite{arxiv:1611.06980}.'
