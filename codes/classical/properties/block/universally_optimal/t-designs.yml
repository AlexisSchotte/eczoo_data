name: 'Design code'

description: |
  A code whose codewords are uniformly distributed in a way that is useful for determining averages of polynomials over the code's underlying space \(X\).
  In that way, the codewords form an approximation of the space.
  A code is a spherical design on \(X\) of \textit{strength} \(t\), i.e., a \(t\)-design on \(X\), if the average of any polynomial of degree up to \(t\) over its codewords is equal to the uniform average over all of \(X\).

  Codes forming designs exist when \(X\) is Hamming space, Johnson space (fixed-weight subspace of Hamming space), or a compact connected two-point homogeneous space (the sphere or the real, complex, quaternionic, or octonionic projective spaces \cite{doi:10.2307/1969427}).
  Complex projective designs are designs on the space of all quantum states, which is \(\mathbb{C}P^{2^n-1}\).

  Designs on the unitary group are called unitary designs \cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0611002}, while \(t\)-designs on the permutation group are called \(t\)-wise permutations \cite{doi:10.1017/S0963548300001917}.
  Existence of designs has been proven for general topological spaces \cite{doi:10.1016/0001-8708(84)90022-7}.

  - 'See Refs. \cite{doi:10.1109/18.720545} for a review of some designs.'
