code_id: block

name: 'Block code'

description: |
  A code defined on a \textit{block} of \(n\) symbols, with each symbol taken from some fixed possibly infinite alphabet \(\Sigma\) \cite[Ch. 3]{doi:10.1007/978-3-642-58575-3}. Such alphabets include bits, Galois fields, rings, or real numbers, and the overall alphabet of the code is \(\Sigma^n\). In this context, \(n\) is called the length of the code.
  In some cases, there are conditions on which length-\(n\) strings are available to the codes. For example, in the case of spherical codes, one is constrained to \(n\)-dimensional real vectors on the unit sphere.

  An alternative more stringent definition (not used here) is in terms of a map encoding logical information from \(\Sigma^k\) into \(\Sigma^n\), yielding an \((n,k,d)_{\Sigma}\) block code, where \(d\) is the code distance.

protection: |
  Block codes protect from errors acting on a few of the \(n\) symbols. A block code with \textit{distance} \(d\) detects errors acting on up to \(d-1\) symbols, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) symbols.
