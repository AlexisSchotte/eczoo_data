code_id: ldgm

name: 'Low-density generator-matrix (LDGM) code'
short_name: 'LDGM'

description: |
  Binary or \(q\)-ary linear code with a sparse generator matrix. More precisely, a member of an infinite family of \([n,k,d]\) codes for which the number of nonzero entries in each row and column of the generator matrix are both bounded by a constant as \(n\to\infty\). The dual of an LDGM code has a sparse parity-check matrix and is called an LDPC code.

#An LDPC code is \((j,k)\)-\textit{regular} if the parity-check matrix has a fixed number of \(j\) nonzero entries in each row and \(k\) entries in each column; otherwise, the LDPC code is \textit{irregular}.

#  A \textit{parity check} is performed by taking the inner product of a row of the parity-check matrix with a codeword that has been affected by a noise channel. A parity check yields either zero (no error) or one (error) for binary codes, while yielding zero (no error) or a nonzero field element (error) for \(q\)-ary codes. Despite the fact that there is more than one nonzero outcome, \(q\)-ary linear codes with sparse parity-check matrices are also called LDPC codes.
