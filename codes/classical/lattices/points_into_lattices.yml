#physical: lattices
logical: points

name: 'Lattice-based code'

description: 'Encodes states (codewords) in coordinates of a lattice in the \(n\)-dimensional real coordinate space \(\mathbb{R}^n\). The number of codewords may be infinite because the coordinate space is infinite-dimensional, so various restricted versions have to be constructed in practice. Since lattices are closed under addition, lattice-based codes can be thought of as linear codes over the reals.'

features:
  rate: 'Due to Shannon's observation that a signal of finite-bandwidth can be represented as a point in real space \cite{manual:{V. A. Kotelnikov, “The theory of optimum noise immunity,” PhD Thesis, Molotov Energy Institute, Moscow, Jan. 1947}}, lattice-based codes can achieve the capacity of the additive Gaussian white-noise channel \cite{doi:10.1109/JRPROC.1949.232969,doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1959.tb03905.x} (see the book \cite{doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-6568-7} for more details).'

      detail: 'Error-correcting codes are defined for a finite alphabet, so only finite lattice-based codes are children.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: linear
      detail: 'Since lattices are closed under addition, lattice-based codes can be thought of as linear codes over the reals.'
