physical: spheres
logical: reals

name: 'Dual polytope code'

description: |
  For any spherical code whose codewords are vertices of a polytope, the dual code consists of codewords that are centers of the faces of said polytope. The dual codewords make up the vertices of the polytope dual to the original polytope.

  If the dual polytope is the same as the original polytope, the original polytope is said to be \textit{self-dual}. 
  Self-dual polytopes have the same number of faces as vertices.
