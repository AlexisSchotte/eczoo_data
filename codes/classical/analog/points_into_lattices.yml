name: 'Lattice-based code'

description: 'Encodes states (codewords) in coordinates of a lattice in the \(n\)-dimensional real coordinate space \(\mathbb{R}^n\). The number of codewords may be infinite because the coordinate space is infinite-dimensional, so various restricted versions have to be constructed in practice. Since lattices are closed under addition, lattice-based codes can be thought of as linear codes over the reals.'

#      detail: 'Error-correcting codes are defined for a finite alphabet, so only finite lattice-based codes are children.'
