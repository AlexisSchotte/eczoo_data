code_id: qam
physical: reals
logical: reals

name: 'Lattice-based QAM code'
short_name: 'Latice QAM'

description: |
  Encodes into points into a subset of points lying on a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^{2n}\), which is usually treated as \(\mathbb{C}^n\).
  Each pair of points is typically associated with a complex amplitude of an electromagnetic signal, and information is encoded into both the norm and phase of that signal using QAM \cite[Ch. 16]{doi:10.1017/9781316822708}.
  QAM schemes with \(q\) points are often called \(q\)-QAM, and \(q\) is often a power of two in order to further concatenate with a binary code.

features:
  rate: 'Nearly achieves Shannon AWGN capacity for two-dimensional constellations in the limit of infinite signal to noise \cite[Fig. 11.8]{doi:10.1017/CBO9780511811401}.'

  parents:
    - code_id: points_into_lattices
      detail: 'A finite lattice QAM encoding consits of points scooped out of an infinite lattice.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: gkp
      detail: 'The GKP code is a quantum analogue of lattice-based QAM.'
    - code_id: gray
      detail: '2D Gray codes are often concatenated with \(n=1\) lattice-based QAM codes so that the Hamming distance between the bitstrings encoded into the points is almost a discretized version of the Euclidean distance between the points \cite[Fig. 2.18]{doi:10.1007/b100498}.'
