name: 'Honeycomb tiling'

alternative_names:
  - 'Hexagonal tiling'

description: |
    A two-dimensional point set whose points are vertices of hexagons.
    It is not a lattice since its points do not form a group under addition.
    As a tiling, its dual (whose points lie at the centers of each triangle) is the triangular tiling.
    The \textit{ruby tiling} is a fattened honeycomb tiling interpolating between the honeycomb tiling and triangular lattice.

      detail: 'The Voronoi cell of the triangular lattice (honeycomb tiling) is a hexagon (triangle). Triangular and hexagonal tilings are dual to each other as tilings, i.e., the vertices of one tiling lie at the centers of faces of the other. Points of the honeycomb tiling form two triangular lattices. The ruby tiling is a fattened honeycomb tiling interpolating between the honeycomb tiling and triangular lattice.'
