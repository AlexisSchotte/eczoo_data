name: 'Lattice-based code'

description: |
  Encodes states (codewords) in coordinates of an \(n\)-dimensional lattice, i.e., a discrete set of points in Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^n\) that forms a group under vector addition when the set is translated such that one point is at the origin. The number of codewords may be infinite because the coordinate space is infinite-dimensional, so various restricted versions have to be constructed in practice. Since lattices are closed under addition, lattice-based codes can be thought of as linear codes over the reals.

  A \(n\)-dimensional lattice-based code can be defined using a generator matrix \(G\) of rank \(n\), where the rows of \(G\) are the lattice translation vectors \(g_i\).
  Any lattice point \(x\) is a linear combination of translation vectors with integer coefficients \(c_i\), \(x = c_1 g_1 + c_2 g_2 \cdots + c_n g_n\).
  A lattice-based code can also be defined using the Gram matrix \(GG^T\).



protection: |
  Lattices are characterized by the \textit{minimum (Euclidean) distance} \(d_{\text{min}}\) between two lattice points, the \textit{kissing number} \(K_{\text{min}}\) of nearest neighbors at each lattice point, and the \textit{volume} \(V=\det G\), which is the volume of the lattice's \textit{fundamental region} that can be used to tile all of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).

  The \textit{nominal coding gain} \(\gamma_{c}\) (a.k.a. \textit{Hermite parameter}) of an \(n\)-dimensional lattice is
  \begin{align}
    \gamma_{c}=\left(d_{\text{min}}/\sqrt[n]{V}\right)^{2}~,
  \end{align}
  characterizing the ratio of the level of protection to the required spatial resources.

  Lattices are also characterized by the \textit{minimal norm} \(\mu\), which is the minimal norm of a non-zero vector in the lattice. This is an analogue of the minimum distance of binary codes. Half of the minimal norm is called the \textit{packing radius}.
