name: 'Analog code'

description: |
  Encodes states (codewords) into coordinates in the \(n\)-dimensional real coordinate space \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
  The number of codewords may be infinite because the coordinate space is infinite-dimensional, so various restricted versions have to be constructed in practice.

  Analog codes provide ways of encoding digital or analog information into the frequency, amplitude, and phase of one or more analog waveforms for transmission through, e.g., an optical fiber or free space.
  This is due to Kotelnikov's \cite{manual:{V. A. Kotelnikov, “The theory of optimum noise immunity,” PhD Thesis, Molotov Energy Institute, Moscow, Jan. 1947}} and Shannon's \cite{doi:10.1109/JRPROC.1949.232969} fundamental observation that a discretized electromagnetic signal of finite-bandwidth can be represented as a point in \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
  In the electromagnetic context, the information stored in the code is called the \textit{bitstream} and coordinates used for encoding are often called \textit{constellations}, \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is called the \textit{signal space}.
  An analog code is mapped into a time-dependent electromagnetic signal using a \textit{modulation scheme} \cite{doi:10.1007/b100498,doi:10.1017/9781316822708}.
  Questions of capacity of electromagnetic communication channels then translate to packing problems in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) \cite{doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-6568-7}.

  There are various ways to encode a set of points in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) into an electromagnetic signal.
  Amplitude encodings include  \textit{pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM)}, which associates each point with a real-valued amplitude of a signal \cite[Sec. 10.5]{doi:10.1017/9781316822708}, and \textit{quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)}, which assocites each pair of points with a complex-valued amplitude \cite[Ch. 16]{doi:10.1017/9781316822708}.

  The primary application of analog codes is to transmist information using electromagnetic signals. The primary noise channel for such signals is called the \textit{additive Gaussian white-noise channel (AGWN)}.

features:
  rate: 'Random analog codes can achieve the capacity of the additive Gaussian white-noise channel \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1959.tb03905.x}; see the book \cite{doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-6568-7} for more details. Deterministic sets of constellations from quadrature rules can also achieve capacity \cite{doi:10.1109/ALLERTON.2010.5706965}.'
