description: |
  Encodes states (codewords) into coordinates in the \(n\)-dimensional real coordinate space \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
  The number of codewords may be infinite because the coordinate space is infinite, so various restricted versions have to be constructed in practice.

  Sphere packings provide ways of encoding digital or analog information into the frequency, amplitude, and phase of one or more analog waveforms for transmission through, e.g., an optical fiber or free space.
  This is due to Kotelnikov's \cite{manual:{V. A. Kotelnikov, “The theory of optimum noise immunity,” PhD Thesis, Molotov Energy Institute, Moscow, Jan. 1947}} and Shannon's \cite{doi:10.1109/JRPROC.1949.232969} fundamental observation that a discretized electromagnetic signal of finite-bandwidth can be represented as a point in \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
  Questions of capacity of electromagnetic communication channels then translate to packing problems in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) \cite{doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-6568-7}.

  In the electromagnetic context, the information stored in the code is called the \textit{bitstream}, coordinates used for encoding are often called \textit{signal points} and form a \textit{constellation}, and \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is called the \textit{signal space}.

  A sphere packing is mapped into a time-dependent electromagnetic signal using a \textit{modulation scheme} \cite{doi:10.1007/b100498,doi:10.1017/9781316822708}.
  There is a close relation between abstract real-space encodings and modulation schemes, and certain simple sphere packings are often synonymous with their corresponding modulation schemes.

  Linear modulation schemes encode points into amplitudes of electromagnetic waveforms.
  \textit{Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM)} associates each point with a real-valued amplitude of one quadrature of an electromagnetic waveform \cite[Sec. 10.5]{doi:10.1017/9781316822708}.
  \textit{Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)} associates each pair of points with a complex-valued two-quadrature amplitude of band-limited signal \cite[Ch. 16]{doi:10.1017/9781316822708}.

#  There are various ways to encode a set of points in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) into an electromagnetic signal.


protection: |
  Sphere packings can be used to transmist information using electromagnetic signals. The primary noise channel for such signals is the \textit{additive Gaussian white-noise channel (AGWN)}, which adds a random Gaussian-distributed displacement to each signal point.
  Protection of a constellation thus depends on how far apart its points are in terms of the Euclidean distance.
  As usual, there is a tradeoff between packing of space and level of protection.

  The \textit{minimum distance} \(d\) of a constellation is the infimum over distances between any two of it''s points.
  The \textit{density} \(\Delta\) is the fraction of the total volume of space that is occupied by spheres of an optimal radius centered at each point in the sphere packing.
  Defining a density for infinite constellations can be done using a limit \cite[pg. 349]{preset:EricZin}.

  The Kabatiansky-Levenshtein bound \cite{manual:{G. A. Kabatiansky, V. I. Levenshtein, “On Bounds for Packings on a Sphere and in Space”, Probl. Peredachi Inf., 14:1 (1978), 3–25; Problems Inform. Transmission, 14:1 (1978), 1–17}} says that any sphere packing must satistfy \(\frac{1}{n}\log_{2}\Delta\lesssim-0.5990\) asymptotically with dimension \(n\).
  Other bounds include the Rogers bound \cite{doi:10.1112/plms/s3-8.4.609}.
  For more details, see \cite[Ch. 10.4]{preset:EricZin}\cite[Ch. 1]{doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-6568-7}.

  The covering problem asks how one can cover all of space by overlapping spheres in the most efficient way.
  The \textit{thickness} \(\Theta\) (a.k.a. covering density or sparsity) of a covering is defined in the same way as the (packing) density, but with the spheres' \textit{covering radius} now being the smallest one such that the spheres cover all space.

  There is an upper bound on the thickness of a covering in dimensions \(n>3\) as well as an asymptotic lower bound,
  \begin{align}
    \frac{n}{e\sqrt{e}}\lesssim\Theta\leq n\ln n+n\ln\ln n+5n~.
  \end{align}

features:
  rate: 'Random sphere packings can achieve the capacity of the additive Gaussian white-noise (AGWN) channel \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1959.tb03905.x}; see the book \cite{doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-6568-7} for more details. Tradeoffs between various parameters have been analyzed \cite{doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1963.tb04013.x}. Deterministic sets of constellations from quadrature rules can also achieve capacity \cite{doi:10.1109/ALLERTON.2010.5706965}.'

  decoders:
    - 'Each signal point is assigned its own Voronoi cell, and a received point is mapped back to the center of the Voronoi cell that it is located upon reception.'
