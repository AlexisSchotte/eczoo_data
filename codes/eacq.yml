name: 'Entanglement-assisted hybrid classical-quantum (EACQ) code'
short_name: 'EACQ'
introduced: '\cite{arxiv:0802.2414,arxiv:0807.2080,arxiv:1911.12260}'

description: |
  Code that encodes quantum and classical information and requires pre-shared entanglement for transmission.

  EACQ block quantum codes on \(n\) Galois qubits of dimensional \(q\) are denoted by \(((n,k:c,d;e))_q\), where \(k\) (\(c\)) is the number of encoded qubits (classical bits), where \(d\) is the distance, and where \(e\) is the required number of pre-shared ebits.
  Similarly, block codes on \(n\) modular qudits are denoted by \(((n,k:c,d;e))_{\mathbb{Z}_q}\).

# arxiv:1701.06963,arxiv:1911.12260 uses union and CWS

protection: |
  The EACQ Singleton bound represents a triple trade-off region in the combined classical-bit, qubit, and e-bit space \cite{arxiv:2202.02184}.

      detail: 'EACQ codes utilize additional ancillary subsystems in a pre-shared entangled state, but reduce to operator-algebra QECCs when said subsystems are interpreted as noiseless physical subsystems.'
