name: 'Binary linear code'

description: 'An \((n,2^k,d)\) linear code is denoted as \([n,k,d]\). Its codewords form a linear subspace, i.e., for any codewords \(x,y\), \(x+y\) is also a codeword. Often defined in terms of a generator matrix \(G\), whose rows form a basis for the subspace. Given a codeword \(x\), the corresponding encoded codeword is \(G^T x\).'

protection: 'Distance \(d\) of a linear code is the number of nonzero entries in the (nonzero) codeword with the smallest such number. Corrects any error set for which no two elements of the set add up to a codeword.'

notes: 'Admits a parity check matrix \(H\), whose columns make up a maximal linearly independent set of vectors that are in the kernel of \(G\).'
