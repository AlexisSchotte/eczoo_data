name: 'q-ary code'

description: 'Encodes \(K\) states (codewords) in \(n\) \(q\)-ary coordinates and has distance \(d\). Usually denoted as \((n,K,d)_q\). The distance is the minimum Hamming distance between a pair of distinct codewords.'

protection: 'Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, and corrects general errors on up to \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) coordinates.'
