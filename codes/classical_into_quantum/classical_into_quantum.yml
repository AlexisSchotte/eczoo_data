name: 'Classical-into-quantum code'

description: |
  Code designed specifically for transmission of classical information through non-classical channels, e.g., quantum channels, hybrid quantum-classical channels, or channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs. Such codes include maps from a classical alphabet into a quantum Hilbert space.

features:

  rate: 'The Shannon channel capacity is the highest rate of classical information transmission through a quantum channel with arbitrarily small error rate \cite{manual:{A. S. Holevo, “Bounds for the Quantity of Information Transmitted by a Quantum Communication Channel”, Probl. Peredachi Inf., 9:3 (1973), 3–11; Problems Inform. Transmission, 9:3 (1973), 177–183},doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.56.131,doi:10.1109/18.651037}.
  This capacity has been calculated for various quantum channels such as AGWN \cite{arxiv:1312.6225} (see Ref. \cite{arxiv:2002.05766} for a review).
  Corrections to the Holevo capacity and tradeoff between decoding error, code rate and code length are determined in quantum generalizations of small \cite{arxiv:1308.6503}, moderate \cite{arxiv:1701.03114,arxiv:1709.05258}, and large \cite{arxiv:1409.3562} deviation analysis.'
