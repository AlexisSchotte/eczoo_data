name: 'Bosonic c-q code'

description: |
  Bosonic code designed for transmission of classical information through non-classical channels.
  Encodes real numbers into coherent states for transmission over a quantum channel and decoding with a quantum-enhanced \textit{receiver}.

  The codes consists of \(K\) coherent states on \(n\) modes, where each state is uniquely defined through the amplitude vectors \(\boldsymbol{\alpha}^j=(\alpha_1^j, \alpha_2^j, â€¦, \alpha_n^j)\} for \{j = {1, 2, \cdots, K}\) known as the codeword.
  The \textit{codebook},
  \begin{align}
  C=\left(\begin{array}{c}
  \boldsymbol{\alpha}^{1}\\
  \vdots\\
  \boldsymbol{\alpha}^{K}
  \end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
  \alpha_{1}^{1} & \alpha_{2}^{1} & \dots & \alpha_{n}^{1}\\
  \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
  \alpha_{1}^{K} & \alpha_{2}^{K} & \dots & \alpha_{n}^{K}
  \end{array}\right)~,
  \end{align}
  collects each codeword into the matrix \(C\) that characterizes the system of states to discriminate.

  From the properties of \(C\), we can assess whether it is possible to optimally discriminate the codebook unambiguously.
  Optimal unambiguous state discrimination requires each vector to be linearly independent, which corresponds to a full-rank codebook.
  This is possible only if \(K \leq n\).
  See review \cite{doi:10.1116/5.0036959} for details on receivers used for bosonic c-q codes.

features:
  rate: 'The Holevo capacity has been calculated for various bosonic quantum channels such as AGWN \cite{arxiv:1312.6225} (see Ref. \cite{arxiv:2002.05766} for a review). Gordon was the first to calculate such capacities for the specific case of bosonic c-q channels \cite{doi:10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288169}.'
