name: 'kerdock'
introduced: '\cite{https://doi.org/10.1016/S0019-9958(72)90376-2}'

description: 'Kerdock code is a \([[2^m, 2^{2m}, 2^{m-1} - 2^{frac{m}{2}-1}]]\) binary code where \(m\) is even. The size of code book is \(|2^{m-1}||R(1,m)|\) where \(R(1,m)\)
is the corresponding first order Reed Muller code. The code is non linear and can exist for perimeters for which there is no linear code (See Nordstrom-Robinson). The relative
minimum distance tends to \(\frac{1}{2}\) as \(m\) becomes large.'

protection: ''

features:

  rate: 'The transmission rate is \(\frac{2m}{2^m}\) which tends to 0 as \(m\) becomes large, hence these codes are asymptotically poor.'

  encoders:
    - 'Specific description of a process that makes the states, usually for quantum codes.'
    - 'Unitary circuit of depth ... \cite{arxiv:old-paper}.'
    - 'Measurement-based preparation ... with ancilla overhead of ... .'
    - 'Leave discussion of fault tolerance to fault-tolerance field.'

  decoders:
    - 'Details about how syndrome measurements are done; discuss overhead, if applicable.'
    - 'MWPM decoding algorithm \cite{doi:good-paper} with ... overhead.'

realizations:
  - 'Code used in DVDs \cite{doi:####...}, 5G, etc.'
  - 'Realized in trapped-ion quantum devices \cite{arXiv:####.#####}, etc.'

notes:
  - 'Kerdock codes can be seen as an extended cyclic code over Z4 (quaternary code), where the appended bit makes the parity of the code 0 \cite{arXiv:math/0207208}.'

      detail: 'Kerdock code is a subcode of second order Reed Muller Code. It consists of a number of cosets of RM(2,m) created by quotienting with RM(1,m).'

      detail: 'Specializes Kerdock code for \(m = 4\). Consequently, the Kerdock set is a set of 8 matrices in \(\mathbb(F)_{2}^{4X4}\). The resulting code is binary with 
      parameters [16, 256, 6].'
