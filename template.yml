code_id: kerdock
physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'kerdock'
introduced: '\cite{https://doi.org/10.1016/S0019-9958(72)90376-2}'

description: 'Kerdock code is a \([[2^m, 2^{2m}, 2^{m-1} - 2^{frac{m}{2}-1}]]\) binary code where \(m\) is even. The size of code book is \(|2^{m-1}||R(1,m)|\) where \(R(1,m)\)
is the corresponding first order Reed Muller code. The code is non linear and can exist for perimeters for which there is no linear code (See Nordstrom-Robinson). The relative
minimum distance tends to \(\frac{1}{2}\) as \(m\) becomes large.'

protection: ''

features:

  rate: 'The transmission rate is \(\frac{2m}{2^m}\) which tends to 0 as \(m\) becomes large, hence these codes are asymptotically poor.'

  encoders:
    - 'Specific description of a process that makes the states, usually for quantum codes.'
    - 'Unitary circuit of depth ... \cite{arxiv:old-paper}.'
    - 'Measurement-based preparation ... with ancilla overhead of ... .'
    - 'Leave discussion of fault tolerance to fault-tolerance field.'

  decoders:
    - 'Details about how syndrome measurements are done; discuss overhead, if applicable.'
    - 'MWPM decoding algorithm \cite{doi:good-paper} with ... overhead.'
    - 'Just-in-time decoder with ... \cite{arxiv:awesome-paper}.'

  # - 'detail'

realizations:
  # List and explain the different "domains" of realizations in list items.
  # Group closely related realizations into a single item. It's OK to have a
  # single list item. Each item should more or less correspond to what would be
  # said in a paragraph.

  - 'Realized in trapped-ion quantum devices \cite{arXiv:####.#####}, etc.'

notes:
  - 'Bounds on n,k, or d for this class, unless mentioned in desciption.'
  - 'Links to code tables, github, GAP algebra packages, more papers \cite{arXiv:####.#####}.'
  - 'Connections to physics; based on \(H^4(\mathcal{BG},\mathbb{Z})\)'
  - 'Can reference other codes, but try to put such connections in the relations fields.'

relations:
  parents:
    - code_id: code_id1
      detail: 'The smallest code family that includes this code that is defined over the same physical space structure or alphabet.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: code_id2
      detail: 'Codes described by a property shared by this code other than physical space (e.g., topological, Hamiltonian-based). Can move to parent if the property was integral in the initial construction/motivation of the code.'
    - code_id: code_id3
      detail: 'Code family of similar encoding but with different physical space structures (qudit vs. qubit surface code).'
    - code_id: code_id4
      detail: 'Codes (classical or quantum) related on other ways to this code.'
