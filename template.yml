physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'kerdock'
introduced: '\cite{https://doi.org/10.1016/S0019-9958(72)90376-2}'

description: 'Kerdock code is a \([[2^m, 2^{2m}, 2^{m-1} - 2^{frac{m}{2}-1}]]\) binary code where \(m\) is even. The size of code book is \(|2^{m-1}||R(1,m)|\) where \(R(1,m)\)
is the corresponding first order Reed Muller code. The code is non linear and can exist for perimeters for which there is no linear code (See Nordstrom-Robinson). The relative
minimum distance tends to \(\frac{1}{2}\) as \(m\) becomes large.'

features:

  rate: 'The transmission rate is \(\frac{2m}{2^m}\) which tends to 0 as \(m\) becomes large, hence these codes are asymptotically poor.'

  encoders:
    - 'Specific description of a process that makes the states, usually for quantum codes.'

  decoders:
    - ''

realizations:
  - 'When a vendor sells copies of some copyrighted work, each copy may be marked with a unique fingerprint. If
illegal copies subsequently appear, the fingerprint enables the vendor
to trace them back to a legal copy and a guilty buyer. If two or more
users collude they can compare their copies. Any differing bit must be
part of the fingerprint, and these detected bits may be changed to producea hybrid copy. A t-collusion-secure fingerprinting code enables
the vendor to trace at least one pirate when a collusion of at most t
users is guilty \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2004.838106}.'


notes:
  - 'Kerdock codes can be seen as an extended cyclic code over Z4 (quaternary code), where the appended bit makes the parity of the code 0 \cite{arXiv:math/0207208}.'

      detail: 'Kerdock code is a subcode of second order Reed Muller Code. It consists of a number of cosets of RM(2,m) created by quotienting with RM(1,m).'

      detail: 'Specializes Kerdock code for \(m = 4\). Consequently, the Kerdock set is a set of 8 matrices in \(\mathbb(F)_{2}^{4X4}\). The resulting code is binary with 
      parameters [16, 256, 6].'
