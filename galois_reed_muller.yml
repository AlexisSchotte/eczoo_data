physical: galois
logical: galois

name: 'Nonbinary Quantum Reed-Muller Codes'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1109/18.771249}'

description: 'A subtype of \( [[n,k,d]]_{GF(q)} \) CSS code where \(n = q^m\), '

features:

rate: 'The transmission rate is \(\frac{2m}{2^m}\) which tends to 0 as \(m\) becomes large, hence these codes are asymptotically poor.'

decoders:
  - 'Soft decision decoding involves extending the Fast Hadamard Transform decoding algorithm for the binary first-order Reed-Muller code to Kerdock code. 
       \cite{doi:10.1109/18.312154}.'
  - 'Complexity of soft decision decoding algorithm: \(4^m\) multiplications and \(m4^m\) additions \cite{arXiv:math/0207208}.'
    
notes:
  - 'Kerdock set is a set of symmetric binary matrices with zero diagonal entries with the property that difference of distinct matrices in the set have full rank.'

  parents:
    - code_id: bits_into_bits
    - code_id: quatenary_over_z4
      detail: 'Kerdock codes can be seen as an extended linear cyclic code over Z4 (quatenary code), where the appended bit is a zero sum check \cite{arXiv:math/0207208}.
      We map the Kerdock codewords to Z4 via the Gray map which is 00->0, 01->1, 11->2, 10->3. It is easy to see that the Gray map is inherently non linear. The map is 
      an isometry provided the metric in the binary space is the standard Hamming metric and the metric in Z4 space is the Lee metric.'  

  cousins:
    - code_id: reed_muller
      detail: 'Kerdock code is a subcode of second order Reed Muller Code. It consists of a number of cosets of \(RM(2,m)\) created by quotienting with \(RM(1,m)\).' 
      
    - code_id: preparata
      detail: 'Dual of Kerdock in the sense of McWilliams weight distribution. These well-known codes are in fact equivalent to a pair of mutually dual
      linear codes over the ring Z4.'
