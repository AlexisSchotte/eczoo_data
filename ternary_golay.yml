name: 'Ternary Golay Code \cite{doi:10.1007/bf03025254}'
introduced: '\cite{manual:{Golay, Marcel JE. "Notes on digital coding." Proc. IEEE 37 (1949): 657.}}'

description: 'The ternary Golay code \(\mathcal{G}_{11}\) is a ternary \([11,6,5]_3\) linear code with the following generator matrix: 
\[ \left[
\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & | & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\ 
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & | & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 2 \\ 
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & | & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & | & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & | & 1 & 0 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\ 
\end{array}
\right] \]

The ternary golay code is a perfect code because with $\(d = 5\)$, \(\mathcal{G}_11\) can correct at most up to 2 errors so the Hamming bound 
is \( 3^11/\sum_{k=0}^{2}{n\choose k}2^k = 729\) which is exactly the number of codewords in \(\mathcal{G}_{11}\). In fact it can be shown that any perfect 
code is either a Hamming code or a ternary or binary Golay code. A Golay code is also a quadratic residue code with residue set \(Q = \{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\} \) with 
generator polynomial \(x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - 1\) over \(\mathbf{F}_3\).
