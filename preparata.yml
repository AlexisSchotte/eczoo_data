physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'preparata'
introduced: '\url{https://doi.org/10.1007/0-387-34799-2_39}'

description: 'Preparata code is a \([[2^{m+1}-1, 2^{m+1}-2m-2, 5]]\) binary code where \(m\) is odd. The size of code book is . The code is non linear and can exist for perimeters 
for which there is no linear code.'

protection: 'Preparata codes are a class of non linear double error correcting codes.'

features:

  rate: 'The transmission rate is \(\frac{2^{m+1}-2m-2}{2^{m+1}-1}\).'

  encoders:
    - ''

  decoders:
    - ''

notes:
  - 'Preparate codes are uniformly packed and nearly perfect which implies that for any word \(textbf{u}\)' and (preparata) codebook C with \(d(\textbf{u}, C) > 2\), we have
     that \(u\) has a distance 2 or 3 to exactly floor((2^{m+1}-1)/3) codewords.'  
  - 'They contain twice as mauy code words as the double-error-correcting BCH codes of the same length, which is the largest number of code words
     possible for given length and distance, i.e., they are optimal\cite{https://doi.org/10.1016/S0019-9958(68)90874-7}.'
