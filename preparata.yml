name: 'preparata'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1007/0-387-34799-2_39}'

description: 'Preparata code is a \((2^{m+1}-1, 2^{m+1}-2m-2, 5)\) binary code where \(m\) is odd. The code is nonlinear, and its size is twice the size of the largest 
possible linear code with the same length and distance. Codewords of extended preparata codes can be thought of as characteristic function of the tuple (X,Y) where 
X, Y belongs to \(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}\) along with the following properties:- (i) \(|X| = |Y| = 2^{m}\) (ii) \(\sum_{x \in X} x = \sum_{y \in Y} y \) 
(iii) \(\sum_{x \in X} x^{3} + (\sum_{x \in X} x)^{3}  = \sum_{y \in Y} y^{3} \). Preparata codes are then obtained by leaving out the coordinate in the 
zeroeth positions in the first half. Preparate codes are uniformly packed and nearly perfect. For any word \(textbf{u}\) and 
(preparata) codebook C with \(d(\textbf{u}, C) > 2\), we have that \(u\) has a distance 2 or 3 to exactly floor((2^{m+1}-1)/3) codewords.'

protection: 'Preparata codes are a class of non linear double error correcting codes. Since the minimum distance is 5, preparata codes can correct \(\frac{5-1}{2} = 4\)
errors.'

features:

  rate: 'The transmission rate is \(\frac{2^{m+1}-2m-2}{2^{m+1}-1}\).'

  decoders:
    - 'Trellis diagrams employed for soft decision decoding.'

notes:
  - 'Preparata codes contain twice as many code words as the double-error-correcting BCH codes of the same length, which is the largest number of code words
     possible for given length and distance. Thus, they are optimal\cite{doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(68)90874-7}.'
