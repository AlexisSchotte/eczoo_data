code_id: preparata
physical: bits
logical: bits

name: 'preparata'
introduced: '\url{https://doi.org/10.1007/0-387-34799-2_39}'

description: 'Preparata code is a \([[2^{m+1}-1, 2^{m+1}-2m-2, 5]]\) binary code where \(m\) is odd. The size of code book is . The code is non linear and can exist for perimeters 
for which there is no linear code.'

protection: 'Preparata codes are a class of non linear double error correcting codes.'

features:

  rate: 'The transmission rate is \(\frac{2m}{2^m}\) which tends to 0 as \(m\) becomes large, hence these codes are asymptotically poor.'

  encoders:
    - ''

  decoders:
    - ''

notes:
  - 'Preparate codes are nearly '

      detail: 'Kerdock code is a subcode of second order Reed Muller Code. It consists of a number of cosets of RM(2,m) created by quotienting with RM(1,m).'

      detail: 'Specializes Kerdock code for \(m = 4\). Consequently, the Kerdock set is a set of 8 matrices in \(\mathbb(F)_{2}^{4X4}\). The resulting code is binary with 
      parameters [16, 256, 6].'
