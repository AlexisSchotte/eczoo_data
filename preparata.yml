name: 'preparata'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1007/0-387-34799-2_39}'

description: 'Preparata code is a \((2^{m+1}-1, 2^{m+1}-2m-2, 5)\) binary code where \(m\) is odd. The code is nonlinear, and its size is twice the size of the largest 
possible linear code with the same length and distance. Codewords of extended preparata codes can be thought of as characteristic function of the tuple (X,Y) where 
X, Y belongs to \(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}\) along with the following properties:- (i) \(|X| = |Y| = 2^{m}\) (ii) \(\sum_{x \in X} x = \sum_{y \in Y} y \) 
(iii) \(\sum_{x \in X} x^{3} + (\sum_{x \in X} x)^{3}  = \sum_{y \in Y} y^{3} \). Preparata codes are then obtained by leaving out the coordinate in the 
zeroeth positions in the first half.'

protection: 'Preparata codes are a class of non linear double error correcting codes.'

features:

  rate: 'The transmission rate is \(\frac{2^{m+1}-2m-2}{2^{m+1}-1}\).'

  encoders:
    - ''

  decoders:
    - 'Trellis diagrams employed for soft decision decoding.'

notes:
  - 'Preparate codes are uniformly packed and nearly perfect which implies that for any word \(textbf{u}\)' and (preparata) codebook C with \(d(\textbf{u}, C) > 2\), we have
     that \(u\) has a distance 2 or 3 to exactly floor((2^{m+1}-1)/3) codewords.'  
  - 'Preparata codes contain twice as many code words as the double-error-correcting BCH codes of the same length, which is the largest number of code words
     possible for given length and distance. Thus, they are optimal\cite{https://doi.org/10.1016/S0019-9958(68)90874-7}.'
  - 'Preparata codes are linear over Z4 with the Lee distance.'
