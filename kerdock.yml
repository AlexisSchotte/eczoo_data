name: 'kerdock'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(72)90376-2}'

description: 'Kerdock code is a \((2^m, 2^{2m}, 2^{m-1} - 2^{frac{m}{2}-1})\) binary code where \(m\) is even. The size of code book is \(|2^{m-1}||R(1,m)|\) where \(R(1,m)\)
is the corresponding first order Reed Muller code. The code is nonlinear, and its size is twice the size of the largest possible linear code with the same length and distance. The relative
minimum distance tends to \(\frac{1}{2}\) as \(m\) becomes large.'

features:

  rate: 'The transmission rate is \(\frac{2m}{2^m}\) which tends to 0 as \(m\) becomes large, hence these codes are asymptotically poor.'

  encoders:
    - 'Boolean functions are of the form \(Q(X) + l(X) + b\)' where \(Q(X) is \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq m} a_{ij}X_{i}X_{j}\), \(l(X)\) is linear in \(m\) variables and \(b\) is 
       in \(\mathbb{F}_{2}\). 
    - 'Codewords are formed as evaluations of these functions over \(\mathbb{F}_{2}^{m}\).'
    - 'The matrices \(A = [a_{ij}]\) constitute the Kerdock set \(K\) (See notes).' 

  decoders:
    - 'Soft decision decoding involves extending the Fast Hadamard Transform decoding algorithm for the binary first-order Reed-Muller code to Kerdock code. 
       \cite{doi:10.1109/18.312154}.'
    - 'Complexity of soft decision decoding algorithm: \(4^m\) multiplications and \(m4^m\) additions \cite{arXiv:math/0207208}.'
    

realizations:
  - 'Kerdock codes find application in digital fingerprinting.'
  - 't - collision secure schemes can be designed to detect a pirated copy once t users have colluded \cite{doi:10.1109/TIT.2004.838106}.'

notes:
  - 'Kerdock set is a set of symmetric binary matrices with zero diagonal entries with the property that difference of distinct matrices in the set have full rank.'
  - 'Kerdock codes can be seen as an extended cyclic code over Z4 (quaternary code), where the appended bit is a zero sum check \cite{arXiv:math/0207208}.'
