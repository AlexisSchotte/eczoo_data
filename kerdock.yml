name: 'Kerdock code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1016/S0019-9958(72)90376-2}'

description: |
  Binary nonlinear \((2^m, 2^{2m}, 2^{m-1} - 2^{frac{m}{2}-1})\) code where \(m\) is even. The size of code book is \(|2^{m-1}||R(1,m)|\), where \(R(1,m)\) is the corresponding first order Reed Muller code.
  This is twice the size of the largest possible linear code with the same length and distance.
  The relative minimum distance tends to \(\frac{1}{2}\) as \(m\) becomes large.

  Let the matrices \(A = [a_{ij}]\) constitute the Kerdock set \(K\), i.e., a set of symmetric binary matrices with zero diagonal entries with the property that difference of distinct matrices in the set have full rank.
  Boolean functions are of the form \(Q(X) + l(X) + b\) where \(Q(X) is \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq m} a_{ij}X_{i}X_{j}\), \(l(X)\) is linear in \(m\) variables and \(b\) is in
  \(GF(2)\).
  Codewords are  formed as evaluations of these functions over \(GF(2)^{m}\). The variable \(X\) represents vectors constituting
  \(GF(2)^{m}\).

features:
  rate: 'The transmission rate is \(\frac{2m}{2^m}\) which tends to 0 as \(m\) becomes large, hence these codes are asymptotically poor.'

  decoders:
    - 'Soft decision decoding involves extending the Fast Hadamard Transform decoding algorithm for the binary first-order Reed-Muller code to Kerdock code \cite{doi:10.1109/18.312154}.'

      detail: 'Kerdock codes can be seen, via the Gray map, as extended linear cyclic codes over \(\mathbb{Z}_4\), where the appended bit is a zero sum check \cite{doi:10.1109/18.312154,arxiv:math/0207208}.'

      detail: 'Kerdock code is a subcode of second order Reed Muller Code. It consists of a number of cosets of \(RM(2,m)\) created by quotienting with \(RM(1,m)\).'
    - code_id: preparata
      detail: 'Preparata codes are dual to Kerdock codes in the sense of McWilliams weight distribution. These well-known codes are in fact equivalent to a pair of mutually dual linear codes over \(\mathbb{Z}_4\).'

      detail: 'Kerdock codes can be obtained by Hensel-lifting Hamming codes to \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) \cite{doi:10.1109/18.312154}.'


# We map the Kerdock codewords to Z4 via the Gray map which is 00->0, 01->1, 11->2, 10->3. It is easy to see that the Gray map is inherently non linear. The map is
# an isometry provided the metric in the binary space is the standard Hamming metric and the metric in Z4 space is the Lee metric.'
