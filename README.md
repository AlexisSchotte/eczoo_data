# Code data for the EC zoo

Code meta-information is stored in YAML format, one file per code.

If you type in new codes, make sure you understand the basics of the
YaML language, and be sure to use a good text editor (if you'd like
a suggestion, check out the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor).

YaML is a common markup language.  You can [google
"YAML tutorial"](https://google.com?q=YaML+tutorial) or check out
the language's [Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).)

## Structure and hierarchy of the data files

See the `template.yml` file to get started.
