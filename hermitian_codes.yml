description: | 
  A Hermitian code is a type of algebraic geometry code where the codewords are evaluations of two-variable polynomials of total degree at most \(D\) on 
  the rational points of a Hermitian curve \(H(X,Y) = X^{q+1}  + Y^{q+1} - 1\). These evaluations may be made in affine coordinates \( (X,Y) \) or 
  over projective coordinates \( [X:Y:Z] \) which contain as a subset the affine coordinates (this is the case when \(Z = 1 \)). In this entry we focus on 
  evaluations over projective coordinates, since doing so increases the length of the code. More precisely, fix \(r, D\) and let 
  \begin{align}
  M_D = \{f \in \mathbb{F}_{q}(X,Y) = \sum_{i+j \leq D}a_{i,j}X^{i}Y^{j}\}
  \end{align}
  be the message space of degree \(D\) polynomials and \(S = \{[X:Y:Z] \in \mathbb{P}^2 \mathbb{F_q} \mid H(X:Y:Z) = 0 \}\) where \(H(X:Y:Z) = X^{q+1} + Y^{q+1} - 
  Z^{q+1}\) is the homogenized Hermitian curve over the projective plane on \( \mathbb{F}_q \). Then the codewords \( C \) of the Hermitian code over \(\mathbb{F}_q\)
  are 
  \begin{align}
  C = \{(f(\alpha_i))_{\alpha_i \in S}, \: f \in M_D \}
  \end{align}.
  The form of the hermitian curve \(H(u,v,w) = u^{q+1} + v^{q+1} - w^{q+1}\) given above is the \textit{Fermat} version of the Hermitian curve. If we use the 
  substitutions \(u = x+z, v = x+y, w = x+y+z \) then we have that \(H(x,y,z) = x^{q+1} - y^{q}z - yz^{q} \) and this is the \textit{Stichtenoth} version of the 
  curve. In fact, in affine coordinates the Stichtenoth form of the curve is \(f(x,y) = x^{q+1} - y^{q} - y = N(x) - Tr(y)\) where \(N\) is the 
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_norm}{field norm} and \(Tr\) is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_trace}{Field Trace}. If viewed in the Fermat
  version again the curve can be written as \(H(u,v,w) = u\overline{u} + v\overline{v} - w\overline{w}\) where the conjugation map 
  \(\overline{u} = u^{q}\) is an isomorphism of \(\mathbb{F}_q \). In fact, when the field of evaluations \(\mathbf{F}_{q^2}\) is viewed as a quadratic extension of 
  \(\mathbf{F}_q\) then the conjugation map is an \(\mathbf{F}_q\)-isomorphism that permutes the roots of the quadratic irreducible polynomial
  used to generate \(\mathbf{F}_{q^2}\) from \( \mathbf{F}_q[x]\).

  - 'When \(D < q + 1 \) the Hermitian code protects against at least \(n - (q+1)J\) errors'
  - 'When \(D \geq q+1 \) the Hermitian code protects against at least \(n-k - \frac{q(q-1)}{2} + 1\) errors'
  
features:

  rate: 
  - 'When \(D < q + 1 \), \(k = \frac{(D+1)(D+2)}{2}\)' 
  - 'When \(D \geq q + 1 \), \(k = (q+1)D - \frac{q(q-1)}{2} + 1 \)'

  decoders:
    - 'Unique decoding using syndromes and error locator ideals: Note that Hermitian codes are linear codes so we can compute the syndrome of a received vector. Moreover, akin to the error-locator ideals found in decoding Reed-Solomon codes, for the multivariate case we must define an error locator ideal \(\Lambda \) such that the variety of this ideal over \(F^{2}_{q}\) is exactly the set of errors. The Sakata algorithm uses these two ingredients to get a unique decoding procedure \cite{manual: {Sakata, Shojiro. "Finding a minimal set of linear recurring relations capable of generating a given finite two-dimensional array." Journal of Symbolic Computation 5.3 (1988): 321-337}}'

notes: 
  - 'Hermitian codes, directly improve Reed-Solomon codes in the sense that RS codes have length at most \(q\) while Hermitian codes have length \(q^3 + 1\)
  - 'Hermitian codes are special examples of Algebraic geometry codes because Hermitian curves have the largest number of points that a curve of a fixed genus can have over a given finite field. So for a curve of fixed genus, Hermitian codes are the algebraic geometry codes which have the maximum possible length'
  - 'Hermitian codes can also come in affine and epicyclic flavours, depending on whether the evaluations are over the affine plane or the bicyclic plane. The affine codes have length \(q^3 - q\) while epicyclic codes have length \((q-2)(q+1)^2\)
