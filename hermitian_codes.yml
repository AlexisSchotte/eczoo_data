description: | 
  A Hermitian code is a type of algebraic geometry code where the codewords are evaluations of two-variable polynomials of total degree at most \(D\) on 
  the rational points of a Hermitian curve \(H(X,Y) = X^{q+1}  + Y^{q+1} - 1\). These evaluations may be made in affine coordinates \( (X,Y) \) or 
  over projective coordinates \( [X:Y:Z] \) which contain as a subset the affine coordinates (this is the case when \(Z = 1 \)). In this entry we focus on 
  evaluations over projective coordinates, since doing so increases the length of the code. More precisely, fix \(r, D\) and let 
  \begin{align}
  M_D = \{f \in \mathbb{F}_{q}(X,Y) = \sum_{i+j \leq D}a_{i,j}X^{i}Y^{j}\}
  \end{align}
  be the message space of degree \(D\) polynomials and \(S = \{[X:Y:Z] \in \mathbb{P}^2 \mathbb{F_q} \mid H(X:Y:Z) = 0 \}\) where \(H(X:Y:Z) = X^{q+1} + Y^{q+1} - 
  Z^{q+1}\) is the homogenized Hermitian curve over the projective plane on \( \mathbb{F}_q \). Then the codewords \( C \) of the Hermitian code over \(\mathbb{F}_q\)
  are 
  \begin{align}
  C = \{(f(\alpha_i))_{\alpha_i \in S}, \: f \in M_D \}
  \end{align}.

   Unique decoding using syndromes and error locator ideals: Note that Hermitian codes are linear codes so we can compute the syndrome of a received 
   vector. Moreover, akin to the error-locator ideals found in decoding Reed-Solomon codes, for the multivariate case we must define an error locator 
   ideal \(\Lambda \) such that the variety of this ideal over \(F^{2}_{q}\) is exactly the set of errors. The Sakata algorithm uses these two ingredients to 
   get a unique decoding procedure \cite{manual: {Sakata, Shojiro. "Finding a minimal set of linear recurring relations capable of generating a given finite 
   two-dimensional array." Journal of Symbolic Computation 5.3 (1988): 321-337}}
